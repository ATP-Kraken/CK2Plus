EVTNAME_Plus_1300;The Empire Flourishes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1300;With [Root.GetTitledFirstName] sitting upon its throne in [Root.Capital.GetName], the Byzantine Empire is still flourishing and has only just begun to show signs of decadence. With the grace of God, [Root.GetSheHe] will be able to maintain its might and perhaps even restore the Roman Empire to its proper place in the civilized world once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1300;Long live the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1301;The Empire Cracks at the Seams;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1301;With [Root.GetTitledFirstName] currently sitting upon its throne in [Root.Capital.GetName], the Byzantine Empire is beginning to crack at the seams. Too many wars that should have been won have instead been lost through mismanagement and decadence, and there are those who say its time is nearing an end. With the grace of God, the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] will be able to reverse this trend and restore the might of the Roman Empire that once was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1302;The Empire is Falling;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1302;With [Root.GetTitledFirstName] currently sitting upon its throne in [Root.Capital.GetName], the Byzantine Empire is in a state of chaos. War after war against the infidels has been lost, and there are those who say it would take the grace of God Himself for the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] to shrug off the decadence of [Root.GetHerHis] court and restore what once was. The might of the Roman Empire of old seems but a distant dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1303;The Empire is Shattered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1303;With [Root.GetTitledFirstName] currently sitting upon its throne in [Root.Capital.GetName], the once-mighty Byzantine Empire is a shadow of its former grace. The court of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] has become decadent and corrupt, and there are many who question the possibility of the empire's mere survival, never mind dream of restoring the Roman Empire that once was. We pray for the grace of God to be bestowed upon the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] in this, our empire's hour of greatest need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1305;The Byzantine Collapse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1305;The Eastern Roman Empire has resisted the slow decay and corruption of its power throughout the Dark Ages, but now it seems entropy has finally taken its toll. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] watches from [Root.GetHerHis] throne in [Root.Capital.GetName] as all of Anatolia slips from the empire's grasp, a sure sign of just how far it has fallen from grace. Many within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s court are already questioning whether it is even possible for the empire to survive the coming days. Whatever the truth, it will take the grace of God Himself to see [Root.GetTitledFirstName] through these dark days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1305;God have mercy on us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1305;Welcome to the deep end;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1306;Collapse of Anatolia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1306;With the eastern provinces in Armenia having been conquered by the Seljuks, the authority of the Byzantine Empire over all of Asia Minor has rapidly begun to crumble. [Root.GetTitledFirstName] watches helplessly from [Root.GetHerHis] throne in [Root.Capital.GetName] as a muslim warlord establishes the so-called 'Sultanate of Rûm' in lands that were, until recently, rightfully [Root.GetHersHis]. Whether the empire will be able to recover from this crippling blow remains to be seen, but all of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s court fervently prays for the grace of God to shine on [Root.GetHerHim] in this, [Root.GetHerHis] darkest hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1307;We have fended off the barbarians from the East as we have done many times before. The Empire once again stands victorious and the crisis is averted…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1307;How else could it possibly have ended?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1308;Word has reached your ears that [From.GetBestName] has been spreading word regarding [From.GetHerHis] claim to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] throne. According to [From.GetHerHim], you are a corrupt ruler who is weakening the empire, and only [From.GetSheHe] can lead it to greatness. Perhaps this is just an exaggeration?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1308;We shall see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1310;Even though you have inherited the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] by the right of feudal succession, your sovereignty is not guaranteed until it is confirmed by the current Basileus. [Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] has the right to take your title away, if [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1310;The Basileus has no rights whatsoever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1310;Let [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] decide our fate, then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1310;Flatter and soothe [Root.Liege.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1310;Crawl before [Root.Liege.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_1310;Maybe a pile of gold?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1311;My glorious liege,\nI have become the new governor of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and I hereby request that you to allow me to retain the title.\n\nYour humble vassal,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1311;I will not take away [From.GetHerHis] title;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1311;No, [From.GetSheHe] may not keep it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1312;[Root.GetTitledFirstName], I have decided that you shall serve me faithfully as the governor of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1312;The right decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1313;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI have decided you are not worthy of commanding the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. I expect you to step down peacefully...there are many ways to serve your Basileus, but this shall not be one of them.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1313;Over the dead, cold bodies of my serfs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1313;I surrender to the will of my liege;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1314;My glorious liege,\nI have become the new governor of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and I beg you to allow me to keep it. I hope that you will take everything into consideration when you make your decision.\n\nYour humble vassal,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1315;[Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYou dare! These lands belong to me by right! If you want them, you shall have to wrest them from me on the field of battle!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1315;Then war it is;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1316;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has accepted your decision and agreed to give up his theme. Now the only question which remains: to whom shall you grant it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1316;To the Imperial Strategos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1316;To my beloved Regent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1316;To a member of my council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1316;To an Imperial dignitary;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_1316;To a relative;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_Plus_1316;To myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_Plus_1316;To anyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1320;While you have ascended onto the Byzantine throne, the empire will remain in a period of transition that will last until your proper coronation by the Ecumenical Patriarch. It is best you do so quickly, lest imperial authority begin to degrade in the meantime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1320;I am the rightful sovereign of all Romans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1321;The new ruler of the Byzantine Empire demands you coronate him the rightful ruler of all the Romans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1321;[From.GetTitledFirstName] shall wear the Imperial crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1321;No, [From.GetSheHe] is unworthy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1322;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to coronate you as the rightful ruler and thus solidify your hold on the throne. Let the preparations for the ceremony begin…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1323;To the noble [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYou should be happy to know that, I, [From.GetTitledFirstName], will hold a coronation ceremony in my honor with the blessing of [FromFrom.GetTitledName]. You have the honor to be invited to attend the coronation, to be held soon in [From.Capital.GetName]. I await your positive reply.\n\nYour Lord and Liege,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1324;The ceremonies are in full swing and the fate of [From.GetTitledFirstName] is being determined - will [From.GetSheHe] continue the inevitable decay of the Roman Empire, or will [From.GetSheHe] stop its advance? It is for you to decide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1324;And strong [From.GetSheHe] shall be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1324;Sadly, [From.GetSheHe] is just another decadent brat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1325;Emperor of the Romans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1325;For centuries the magnificent Constantinople, Queen of the Cities, was a capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. Today this glorious city is full of joy - a new ruler ascends to the throne and a magnificent coronation takes place in the Hagia Sophia.\n\n'In the name of Iesous Christos Pantocrator, Lord of the Kosmos, I, [Root.GetFirstName], accept the Imperial Crown from the hands of [From.GetFirstName], Patriarch of Konstantinoupolis, and solemnly swear before the Senate and People of Rome as your [Root.GetTitle] to rule with justness, fairness and divine guidance, to protect this Holy Church from all evil and, by the grace of our Savior, to never let the light of our True Faith and this Basileia Rhomaion to dim. So help me God!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1325;Glorious your reign shall be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1325;Long live the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1326;[From.GetTitledName] crowned you in Hagia Sofia with all the pomp and ceremony due your station, but the air is regrettably one of formality. You get the definite sense that nobody quite believes you are the [Root.GetManWoman] to restore greatness to the Eastern Roman Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1326;I still get to wear the crown, don't I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1327;'In the name of Iesous Christos Pantocrator, Lord of the Kosmos, I, [Root.GetFirstName], accept the Imperial Crown from the hands of [FromFrom.GetFirstName], Patriarch of Konstantinoupolis, and solemnly swear before the Senate and People of Rome as your [Root.GetTitle] to rule with justness, fairness and divine guidance, to protect this Holy Church from all evil and, by the grace of our Savior, to never let the light of our True Faith and this Basileia Rhomaion to dim. So help me God!'\n\nWith those words does [From.GetSheHe] become [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in truth, with each of [From.GetHerHis] vassals lining up to bow before [From.GetHerHim] and swear everlasting fealty. It is an impressive ceremony, full of pomp and circumstance...though there is a lingering feeling among those present that they are witnessing not a resurgence of the empire's greatness, but simply one more step in its inevitable decline.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1327;Too bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1328;The traitorous [From.GetTitledFirstName] has refused to crown you! You can, of course, depose him and appoint someone more loyal to perform the coronation, but that probably won't be seen in a very favorable light by the faithful. What shall we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1328;Let's show [From.GetHerHim] some caesaropapism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1328;I will bow before the will of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1338;The Ascension of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1338;While some initially considered [Root.GetHerHim] to be a weak ruler, perhaps one destined to be lost in the history books, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has proven [Root.GetHerHim]self over the last years of [Root.GetHerHis] rule to be effective...so much so that some in the Byzantine Empire are now whispering [Root.GetHerHis] name in the same tones once reserved for the great emperors of times past. There is a renewed belief that [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will lead the empire onto a great path, perhaps even all the way to the restoration of the Roman Empire of old!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1338;I certainly hope so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1338;Long live the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1338;We shall see;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
