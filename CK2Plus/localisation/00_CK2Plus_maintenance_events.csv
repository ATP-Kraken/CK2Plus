EVTNAME_Plus_372;Invalid Checksum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_372;Bad news, it looks like your checksum is [ValidateChecksum]. This means that it is very likely that your CK2 or CK2 Plus installation is corrupt in some way. Please do the following:\n1) Verfiy Crusader Kings 2 installation in Steam and make sure that checksum displayed on launcher is correct!\n2) Delete OLD CK2 Plus mod files and redownload and reinstall the mod.\n3) DO NOT use other mods with CK2 Plus. They are NOT compatible, and NOT supported. If you are using a mod designed for Plus let the mod owner know, so they can add the correct checksum to their mod file.\n\nBR,\nCK2 Plus Team;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
