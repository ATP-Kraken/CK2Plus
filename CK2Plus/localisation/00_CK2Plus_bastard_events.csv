EVTDESC_Plus_1350;I have been gearing up for this confrontation for some time now. I have gained an audience, and will ask my father to recognize me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1350;It's now or never...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1351;It was rather unexpected when [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked for an audience, but when [From.GetSheHe] arrived [From.GetSheHe] explained that [From.GetSheHe] is a fully-grown [From.GetManWoman]...one that [From.GetSheHe] hopes is worthy of being considered your legitimate [GetFromRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1351;That is not going to happen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1351;Convince [From.GetHerHim] why this cannot be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1351;Refuse, but buy [From.GetHerHim] an estate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1351;Legitimize [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1352;[From.GetTitledFirstName] shook his head. 'No,' he said. 'That is simply never going to happen. Put it out of your head.' Then he had me escorted from the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1352;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1352;This isn't right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1353;[From.GetTitledFirstName] listened to me for some time, and then he sat me down and we talked at length. He explained the political realities in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and why legitimizing me would complicate things. I'm disappointed, but I do see the truth in his words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1354;[From.GetTitledFirstName] listened to my plea for some time. While he ultimately did refuse to legitimize me, he offered me an estate off of which to live. It will make me a [Root.GetLordLady] of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName], but is that enough?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1354;No, it's not enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1355;'Know that I, [From.GetTitledName], hereby consider [Root.GetTitledFirstName] to be my legitimate child and to be considered such throughout [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. [Root.GetSheHeCap] will take [Root.GetHerHis] rightful place within the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty and among my heirs. By the grace of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] shall this be so.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1361;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has inherited the [FromFrom.GetFullName], a title that should rightfully belong to me. I have the feeling that many of [From.GetHerHis] vassals would agree. Perhaps I should make my case to them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1361;[FromFrom.GetName] is rightfully mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1361;No, let [From.GetTitledFirstName] have it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1362;Word reaches you that your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has made a claim against your titles. [From.GetSheHeCap] is trying to win the support of your vassals, and it's possible some of them might actually agree with [From.GetHerHis] cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1362;Damn [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1362;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in prison at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1363;Word reaches you that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has made a claim against [From.GetTitledFirstName], claiming [FromFrom.GetSheHe] should rightfully have been the heir to the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. It is not uncommon for bastards to do this, and you suspect there are some who might agree with [FromFrom.GetHerHis] cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1363;I agree--[FromFrom.GetSheHe] should rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1363;No, I support [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1370;Recently, you discovered that [Root.Father.GetTitledFirstName] was never your father at all. Should you confront your real father and demand the truth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1370;I need to know the truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1370;I am a [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName], and that's all that matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1371;[From.GetTitledFirstName] recently came to me, saying that [From.GetSheHe] recently learned that [From.Father.GetTitledFirstName] was not, in fact, [From.GetHerHis] real father. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] believes I am. It's true, of course, but now [From.GetSheHe] expects an answer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1371;Tell [From.GetHerHim] the truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1371;Deny it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1371;Convince [From.GetHerHim] it's not true;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1372;[From.GetTitledFirstName] sighed heavily when I confronted him, but eventually nodded. 'I can't be certain,' he admitted, 'but I was close to your mother once, and you were born during that time. You are my child.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1372;Then I want to be recognized as such;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1372;That's all I wanted to know;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1373;I asked [From.GetTitledFirstName] for the truth, and he looked me straight in the eye and said he wasn't my father. It's not true, of course, but obviously he will lie to my face about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1373;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1374;[From.GetTitledFirstName] appeared genuinely confused when I confronted him. 'I knew your mother once, it's true,' he admitted, 'but that's all. [Root.Father.GetTitledFirstName] is surely your father. You even have his look about you.' I felt embarrassed to have even brought it up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1374;I suppose I was mistaken;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1375;To my surprise, [From.GetTitledFirstName] merely nodded and turned to leave after I told [From.GetHerHim] the truth. 'I only wanted to hear it from your own lips,' [From.GetSheHe] said. I wonder if this is the last I will hear of it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1376;[From.GetTitledFirstName] nodded when I told [From.GetHerHim] the truth. 'Then recognize me. If I am truly your kin, I want to be known as such. I have rights, do I not?';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
