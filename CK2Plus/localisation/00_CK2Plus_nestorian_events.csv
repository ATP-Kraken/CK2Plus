EVTDESC_Plus_3600;Assyrian culture has been present since antiquity in the Levant and Mesopotamia and ruled much of it under the guidance of powerful kings. Later on, Saint Nestorius founded our very own church, distinct from the other Arab Christians. We speak our own language and maintain our own traditions, as we have for millennia. To some, we are the only true heirs of Syria and Mesopotamia unlike the Muslim Arabs. As I am a Nestorian myself, perhaps it is time I embrace that distinction from the Arabs around me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3600;Yes, I am Assyrian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3600;No, there is no point;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3601;The Nestorian Arabs in [Root.GetName] have slowly begun to adopt the language and traditions of the Assyrian.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3602;While I am in every way Assyrian, I am not Nestorian, and it seems pointless to hold onto outdated ways that are so closely tied to the Nestorian faith, does it not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3602;True, I am really an Levantine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3602;No, I am Assyrian and will remain thus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3603;With the people in [Root.GetName] no longer clinging to the Nestorian faith, their Assyrian traditions and language have begun to fall to the wayside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
