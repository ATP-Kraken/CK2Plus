EVTDESC_Plus_304;The change in crown authority has forced me to change some of my demesne laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_310;My changes to the crown authority of the Empire have now been fully implemented across the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_325;This was not a just act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_325;Oh well;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_326;I have reclaimed the Byzantine Empire for the Orthodox faith. The title of Augustus is rightfully mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_326;Glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_334;The province of [converted_province.GetName] has finally seen the light, with the majority of its inhabitants at last accepting your culture. This should make your realm easier to manage and better unify your people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_336;Those who have gone into hiding have been sent a message to return.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_361;One of the startup flags has gone missing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_600;I have assembled the lords and ladies of the [changed_title.GetFullName] to vote on my proposed Succession Law change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_601;I have decided to institute the Gavelkind Succession Law in the [changed_title.GetFullName]. All that is needed is the support of yourself and my other loyal vassals.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_605;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has made a change to the [emf_succ_title.GetFullName]'s succession laws... a change which has ensured that not only are you no longer the heir, you are no longer even considered a contender for succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_605;So be it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_605;How dare [From.GetSheHe]! This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_606;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has made a change to the [emf_succ_title.GetFullName]'s succession laws... a change which has ensured that you are no longer [From.GetHerHis] primary heir, even though you are still considered a candidate for succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_608;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has made a change to the [emf_succ_title.GetFullName]'s succession laws... a change which has elevated me to the status of [From.GetHerHis] primary heir. Be careful of the jealous eyes now cast your way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_609;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has made a change to the [emf_succ_title.GetFullName]'s succession laws... a change which, while it has not made me [From.GetHerHis] heir, has put me in the immediate line for succession.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_Plus_613;Yes, establish a new dynasty in [From.GetBaseName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_613;No, emphasize our ties to House [FromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_614;[From.GetTitledName] has taken the throne in the [From.GetFullBaseName] and established the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty as a cadet branch of the [FromFromFrom.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus.1454;This decision allows you to play a completely different game. By proceeding you will be able to generate a completely random world with the option of ancient religions, or standard religions. You will even be able to decide if everyone starts as a count, duke or king. Please keep in mind that if this is a multiplayer game only the host should do these options.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus.1454;Sounds intriguing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus.1454;What nonsense;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus.1455;Would you like to use standard religions, or ancient religions (such as Kemetic, Celtic etc)?\nThe game will appear to be frozen and non-responsive after picking this choice, this is normal and you must simply wait. A lot of messages will also appear afterwards, just hold the enter key to get rid of them easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus.1455;Standard Religions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus.1455;Ancient Religions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus.1455;Nevermind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus.1456;What tier would you like all independent rulers to be?\n\nAs last time, the game will appear frozen and unresponsive, this is normal just wait it out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus.1456;Counts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_Plus.1456;Kings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus.1457;The map is now almost done being generated. \n\nPlease run the game at speed 1 for one day, then pause. Once the game has caught up you may finally play. It is highly suggested that you afterwards save your game in case issues arise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus.1457;Onto a brave new world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3101;News has arrived that a new island in the far north-west has been discovered, by a viking of the name 'Naddoddur'. The claims of this viking have even been confirmed by a second by the name of 'Garðarr Svávarsson'. The name 'Iceland' has begun to come in use for this new island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3101;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3102;Further news of this 'Iceland' has arrived. It would seem vikings, unhappy with the current state of their homeland, have begun earnest attempts at settling the land there. Word is that, despite the name, it is a rather hospitable and fertile island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3102;What a tale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3103;Even more news from Iceland. It would seem the settlement of the island is finally complete and a gathering of its inhabitants was held, called the 'Alþingi' to discuss matters of the island. It was held at the Lögberg, or Law Rock. It would seem the island now has the beginnings of a proper realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3103;They've come a long way;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2701;This event will allow you to replace the religions of the entire world with pagan equivalents. It will leave the currently existing political entities in place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2701;Let it be so;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2703;This decision allows you to start the game with the closest approximation possible to vanilla's ahistorical de Jure empires.\nPlease note that depending on the bookmark chosen and the kingdoms present there-in results may vary slightly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2703;Sounds Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2705;Under normal circumstances the Aztecs have a very minor chance of appearing in CK2+ with their DLC enabled.\nBy using this setup option however they become just as likely to appear as in vanilla CK2.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2706;Much time has passed since you started your campaign and the year 1453 has finally arrived.\nNormally this would be the end of the game however if you wish you may continue playing as much as you want. Perhaps there is just a little bit more you wanted to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2706;Just a bit longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_Plus_2707;Normally when you start a game of CK2+ at 1000 or later the German culture is split apart. By using this customization option you will revert all German sub-cultures, like Bavarian, Swabian, Franconian etc, back to one unified German culture.\nThis cannot be undone once this option has been chosen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_Plus_2707;Normally when you start a game of CK2+ before 1000 the German culture will eventually split apart over time. By using this customization option you will prevent all German sub-cultures, like Bavarian, Swabian, Franconian etc, from splitting off of.\nThis cannot be undone once this option has been chosen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2709;This decision locks all realms, where possible, to be completely gender equal in all ways. It also prevents adjusting away from laws that would break this balance. Please note some titles cannot be changed due to hardcoded limitations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2711;This decision will prevent religious heads from calling Crusades/Jihad, for a certain period of time. Here you can select for how long do you want to delay the Crusades/Jihad. Please note, that if the religious head dies, he will be able to start the Crusade/Jihad earlier;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2711;1 year;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2711;3 years;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2711;5 years;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2260;Constantinople Overrun;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2260;After years of religious conflict in Byzantium, it seems heretics have prevailed against Greek Rite Chalcedonians. Heretic [current_patriarch.GetTitledName] now completely controls the Church in the east and is fully supported by the Greek Emperor. Now, it is no longer possible to avert the coming schism, and it is thought to be only a matter of time before the division becomes official.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2260;There's nothing we can do about it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2260;Cursed heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2260;I suppose we shall have to wait and see;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2260;This is none of our concern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_3390;[Root.GetBestName] has deserves a proper reward for his loyalty to the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_3390;I will grant him a landed title!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_3390;A titular title is more appropriate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PLUS_311;It would seem one of your trade posts has fallen in complete disrepair and had to be abandoned. This disrepair was caused by your lack of of advancement in 'Trade Practices' compared to the number of trade posts you held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
