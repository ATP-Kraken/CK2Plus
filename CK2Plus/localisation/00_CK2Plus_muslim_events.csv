EVTNAME_Plus_1900;Anarchy at [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1900;Dire events are underway in [Root.Capital.GetName], capital to the mighty [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]: [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], considered by many to be a weak caliph, has been turned into a veritable prisoner within his own palace. His advisors have taken control of the court, and already cracks have begun to appear in its authority over the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s vassals. Whether [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will be able to regain control or whether the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] will crumble into anarchy is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1900;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1900;This travesty is an affront to Allah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1900;It couldn't happen to a nicer caliph;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1901;While [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has taken command of the Sunni caliphate, the court remains firmly in control. You will have to be strong if you are to overcome their rule and restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1901;They will not get away with this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1902;Order Restored in [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1902;It has taken a bloody coup, with [imprisoned_regent.GetTitledName] being overthrown and imprisoned, but [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has restored order in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. The Sunni caliphate once again has authority respected by its vassals. It remains to be seen whether [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will exact more vengeance upon those of his court who kept him hostage, and whether he will be able to bring the lands he lost back under his fold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1902;Ha! Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1902;This is a good thing, I think;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1904;The court of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] runs rampant with anarchy and corruption. Perhaps it is time for the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] to declare its independence before the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] crumbles completely and takes you with it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1904;Yes, let us make our own way;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1904;No, I am loyal to the caliph!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1905;Alas, the anarchy rampant within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] has claimed another victim: from your quarters in the palace, you hear that [From.GetTitledName] has declared [From.GetHerHis] independence from the caliphate in pure disgust. Naturally your court is at odds regarding what to do about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1907;After the unjust murder of his son by local authorities, a follower of the Kharijite sect of Islam by the name of Musawir ibn 'Abd al-Hamid al-Shari has launched an insurrection in the province of Mosul, aiming to toppling the rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. This presents a serious threat to the caliph, and further evidence of the reign of anarchy in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1907;Muslim heretics in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]? Good news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1907;Another sad blow to the caliphate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1910;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] is difficult to manage, due to its sheer size and splendor. It is an easy thing for the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s court to become decadent amidst such wealth, and for power to be misused even if that is not something the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1910;I will see this corruption rooted out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1910;This is hardly unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1912;[From.Religion.GetName] leaders in [From.GetName] are becoming increasingly displeased at the decadence of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty under [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. They are stirring discontent against you, and only quick and brutal action could possibly stop their words from taking hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1912;Ignore it, for now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1912;Round up the agitators and execute them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1915;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nI write you now because I can endure your sins no further. You are a [GetFromFromRootInsult] [Root.GetManWoman], and an apostate in the eyes of Allah. I hereby declare you Kafir!\n\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1915;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1916;My liege,\nThough it pains me to say it, I can no longer watch your descent into sin. You are a [GetFromFromRootInsult] [Root.GetManWoman], and an apostate in the eyes of Allah. I hereby declare you Kafir!\n\n[FromFrom.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_family;[Root.GetTitledName] is brought up from the dungeon and escorted to the plaza in [From.Capital.GetName], in front of the cheering crowds and [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] looking on. There, as the sword is raised above [Root.GetHerHis] neck, [Root.GetSheHe] looks at [Root.GetHerHis] [GetFromRelation] with pleading eyes. 'Don't do this, [From.GetFirstName]! There has to be some other way...' Alas, there was not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_family;You are family, but this is how it must be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_spouse;[Root.GetTitledName], [GetHusbandWife] of [From.GetTitledName], is dragged into the central square of [From.Capital.GetName], where a huge bonfire roars. In a last, desperate effort to save [Root.GetHerselfHimself], [Root.GetSheHe] calls out to [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. 'I have always loved you, [Root.GetFirstName], and I always shall!' But it is not enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_spouse;Forgive me then, my love, but this is how it must be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_dynasty;[Root.GetTitledName] is brought up from the dungeons and placed at the block in front of a cheering crowd in [Root.Capital.GetName]'s central square. As they raise the sword above [Root.GetHerHis] neck, [Root.GetSheHe] cries out to the watching [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]: 'Don't do this, [From.GetFirstName]! We are family, and of the same blood!' But the sword descends even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_dynasty;It is not enough to save you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_saoshyant;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] spits at the ragged creature curled into a ball before [From.GetHerHim]. 'King of Kings,' [From.GetSheHe] mocks, with a sharp kick to the kidneys, 'Bringer of Benefit. There is only one Bringer of Benefit, and that is Allah, whose truth and love you have rejected for idolatry.' [From.GetSheHeCap] raises a great scimitar, shining steel reflecting the screaming crowd, and beheads [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_saoshyant;I hope Allah has a special jinn waiting for your soul;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_pope;[Root.GetTitledName] is dragged, stumbling and bloody, before a screaming crowd in [From.Capital.GetName]. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] regards [Root.GetHerHim] and laughs. 'This broken old [Root.GetManWoman], covered in [Root.GetHerHis] own filth, dressed in ragged, once-fine robes, is the [Root.GetManWoman] who commanded a hundred legions of infidels to invade Dar al-Islam? You are so pathetic, it is not even worth the torture. Just cut off [Root.GetHerHis] head.' The attendants rush to do just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_pope;Pray your carpenter comes to save you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_patriarch;[Root.GetTitledName] flinches, but does not scream, as the nails are pounded through [Root.GetHerHis] hands. The crown in [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square cheers wildly, while [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] looks on. 'You are brave,' [From.GetSheHe] calls out, 'I will give you that. But you should thank me! I am giving you the chance to die like your false savior!';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_patriarch;I wonder if [Root.GetSheHe] sees [Root.GetHerHis] house from there;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_caliph;The blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to him: 'Your sins are great, for there can be no peace when the Commander of the Faithful is not faithful to Allah. Pray for forgiveness now, and maybe Allah will forgive you when you meet Him.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_caliph;And I shall send you to Him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_jewish_head;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim]: 'You have kept your faith, that is true. But it is now obsolete. Convert to Islam, or die.' The [Root.GetManWoman] makes no response, save to spit in the ground before the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], sealing [Root.GetHerHis] fate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_jewish_head;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_zoro_head;[Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a roaring bonfire and a wildly screaming crowd. [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim]: 'All that work to restore your false religion, yet in the end it is undone once more. Your people worship fire, yes?' [From.GetSheHeCap] grins wickedly at the bonfire, radiating intense heat. 'Let us see how much it likes you.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_zoro_head;Not that much, as it turns out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_king_israel;[Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s jailors have not been kind to this so-called '[Root.GetKingQueen] of the Jews'. Body battered, face broken and bruised, yet [Root.GetSheHe] still stands tall against the jeering crowd. [Root.GetSheHeCap] breathes a prayer as [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] raises [From.GetHerHis] blade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_king_israel;[Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] take your soul!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_emperor;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim]: 'All your worldly power, all those armies at your command. They are not but dust in the face of Allah.' The command is given, and [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] dies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_emperor;Allah may show you mercy, but I shall not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_christian_head;The crowd in [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square screams wildly as the execution of [Root.GetTitledName] is carried out. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] looks at the corpse of the [Root.GetManWoman], hanging broken and crucified upon the cross. 'I must give [Root.GetHerHim] credit,' [From.GetSheHe] says. '[Root.GetSheHeCap] did not cry out, not even in the end.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_christian_head;A pity such a brave [Root.GetManWoman] followed a false religion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_pagan_head;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim]: 'You pagans may have the trappings of a religion, but you are no better than monkeys, imitating your betters. There is but one true faith, and that is written in the Qur'an. Pray to your false idols, but they will not save you.' With those words, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s fate is sealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_pagan_head;Goodbye, idolater;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_king;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim]: 'Give me your trust said the King on his throne,' [From.GetSheHe] quotes, 'but there is no King one should trust but Allah. You have turned your back on the Highest, and now He has turned his back on you.' With those words, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s fate is sealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_king;Let the true King show mercy upon you;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_crusader;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [Root.GetSheHeCap] is thrown before [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], who spits on [Root.GetHerHim] in disgust. 'You pigs invade our lands, massacre our people and defile our holy lands with your false god. I tell you this - your death, no matter how agonizing, is far better than you deserve.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_crusader;And I will make it quite agonizing indeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_sayyid;[Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim]: 'You have the blood of the Prophet in you, yet you turn against Him. Death is nothing compared to the tortures that await you in the afterlife. But out of respect for the Prophet, I will not shed your blood.' [From.GetSheHeCap] points to the nearby cistern of water, where [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is to be drowned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_sayyid;It was done respectfully, I think;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_duke;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim]: 'You are a wise and noble [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], and I am sorry it has come to this.' Then [From.GetSheHe] smiles. 'Or, rather, I am sorry I will not receive a ransom for you.' With those words, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s fate is sealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_duke;Faith is more important than gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_kafir;[Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim]: 'You have betrayed your God and his Commandments. For the sin of apostasy, I hereby sentence you to death!' The crowd cheers as [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] raises [From.GetHerHis] sword high above the Kafir's head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_kafir;Allah may show you mercy, but I shall not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_pirate;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim]: 'You are a mighty fighter, [Root.GetManWoman] of the pale North, but there is no strength greater than that of Allah.' With those words, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s fate is sealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_pirate;Let judgement be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_genius;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim] with a wry grin: 'They say you are a very clever [Root.GetManWoman]...but have you thought of a way to save yourself?' [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] says nothing, and thus [Root.GetHerHis] fate is sealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_genius;Not clever enough, it seems;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_imbecile;The bruised and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. As [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] walks up to [Root.GetHerHim], [From.GetSheHe] realizes a certain amount of the jeers are directed at [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps slaying a drooling moron isn't the most dignified way to honour Allah, or impress the people. Even so, it must be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_imbecile;[Root.GetSheHeCap] barely understood what was happening...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_count;The dazed and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. As [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] watches, the court imam makes a declaration: 'This sinner has grievously offended Allah, and persisted in their error even when confronted with the truth. For such a sinner, there is nothing but death.' With those words, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s fate is sealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_count;Allah may show you mercy, but I shall not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1917_generic;The dazed and blindfolded [Root.GetTitledName] is dragged from the dungeons into [From.Capital.GetName]'s central square, before a screaming crowd. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is not even present to witness the execution, but [From.GetHerHis] court imam makes a declaration: 'This sinner has grievously offended Allah, and persisted in their error even when confronted with the truth. For such a sinner, there is nothing but death.' With those words, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s fate is sealed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1917_generic;Allah may show you mercy, but I shall not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1917;A terrible way to die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1917;Alas, poor [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1917;Such is as Allah commands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1920;To prove you are free from the sin of gluttony, you have decided you shall publicly fast for ten days in repentance, while praying for the intercession of Allah.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1920;Hunger is a demon to be defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1921;It is done. Your fast is over, and while it has left you weak, you have demonstrated your piety and a new appreciation for temperance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1921;Everything in moderation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1922;Charity is one of the most important virtues of Islam. To prove your charitable nature, you go among the poor and distribute a great deal of your wealth, and then pray with the lowest of the low.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1922;Wealth is a curse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1923;It is the responsibility of every Kharijite to spread the faith with determination and ardor. To prove your dedication, you will spend your days memorizing the Holy Qur'an until you can repeat it for the imams, no matter how stressful it might be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1923;It was difficult, but I did it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1924;A Kharijite must strictly obey Sharia law as written in the Holy Qur'an, and not deviate from it. To prove your dedication, you place the decisions of your court in the hands of the Grand Muffi, and listen intently as his pronouncements are made.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1924;It was a burden, anyway;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1925;Every Muslim must put his full faith in the Holy Qur'an, and never doubt or question it. Thus you redouble your efforts to publicly prove your faith, attending services at the mosques with renewed ardor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1925;But do I truly believe the words I speak?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1925;I will repeat the words, but I do not truly believe them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1926;Your addiction to drink is a curse, and to overcome it your redouble your efforts in every other facet of your life until you think of it no more. You publicly debase yourself before Allah and commit public penance, to prove that you are no longer the [Root.GetManWoman] they believe you to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1926;Forgive me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1927;Your immoral lifestyle flies in the face of the Prophet's commandments, and so you eschew all personal desires and instead rededicate yourself to every other facet of your life. You publicly debase yourself before Allah and commit public penance, to prove that you are no longer the [Root.GetManWoman] they believe you to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1928;Decadence is the bane of a Muslim's existence, and you have allowed yourself to wallow in your personal worth for too long. Now you rededicate yourself to every other facet of your life, publicly debasing yourself before Allah and committing public penance, to prove you are no longer the [Root.GetManWoman] they believe you to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1929;Though once considered kafir, an apostate in the eyes of Allah due to [Root.GetHerHis] sinful nature, [Root.GetBestName] has committed public penance and divested [Root.GetHerselfHimself] of all immoral desires. Thus [Root.GetSheHe] is ready to be accepted back into the fold as a true Kharijite, deemed worthy by the imams.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1929;Praise Allah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1929;Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1930;Your latest collection of Islamic poetry has made quite the stir at court, and your courtiers can't stop talking about them. Your fame as a poet is spreading rapidly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1932_incapable;The work on your epic poetry has, unfortunately, come to an end. You no longer have the mental capacity to pursue it, and the body of work you have created up to this point will, undoubtedly, have to serve as your lasting legacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1932_prisoner;Sadly, the work on your epic poem has come to an end now that you are imprisoned. You're not even certain you'll be able to pick up where you were once you get out...if you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1932_war;The work on your epic poem is unfortunately delayed due to the outbreak of the war. All is not lost, however! You will pick up the quill once more once all this war business is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1932_depressed;Your dark mood has removed all desire to work on your epic poem for the time being. Indeed, the despair lingers such that you're uncertain you'll ever pick it up again. What effect does poetry have on the world, after all? Anything?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1932_stressed;You have found yourself so stressed over the last year that you just can't see yourself continuing work on your epic poem for the time being...perhaps ever. You shall have to see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1932_sick;The malady from which you suffer has made it impossible to progress on your epic poem. Perhaps once you are feeling better, the writing will resume. But for now? Getting over your illness is all you can truly think about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1933;Work continues on your epic poem, but as of late your find it...lacking a certain something. You need some inspiration, something to shake up your creative juices. Where will you look for that inspiration?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1933_women;With women, and plenty of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1933_men;With handsome men, and plenty of them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1933;With a great deal of wine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1933;With song, merriment, and trouble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1933;Why must I limit myself to just one thing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1934;Work continues on your epic poem, but you have run into a problem: to firmly set it in the correct zeitgeist, you need to properly set the scene...and that requires you to look for sources of information outside of your everyday experience.  Where should you start your investigation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1934;Observe the fashions and intrigues of court;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1934;Spend time with your soldiers, and talk of war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1934;Study the tales of history in the library;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1935_female;Work continues on your epic poem, and lately you have found that a certain young and beautiful woman at court has served marvelously as your muse. Sadly, her heart is spoken for...but, even so, your thoughts are consumed with thoughts of her, to the exclusion of your work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1935_male;Work continues on your epic poem, and lately you have found that a certain handsome young man at court has served marvelously as your muse. Sadly, his heart is spoken for...but, even so, your thoughts are consumed with thoughts of him, to the exclusion of your work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1935;Satisfy your carnal desires elsewhere;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1935;Is not unrequited love a source of inpiration as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1935_female;I will have her, no matter what!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1935_male;I will have him, no matter what!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1936;You have tried to progress on your epic poem, but as of late you find yourself suffering from severe writer's block. You spend all day staring at an empty parchment, unable to put down anything of note in words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1936;Shake things up with a party!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1936;Lock yourself in a minaret until you write something;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1937;You have tried to progress on your epic poem, but you find yourself giving more and more into despair. Nothing you write seems to have any worth to you, and the words simply never flow. Perhaps you are not the poet everyone thinks you are?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1937;I should put this aside before I embarrass myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1937;No! I will keep trying, no matter what!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1938;You pause to realize that you have barely worked on your epic poem in the last year. Things keep coming up at court, one distraction after another, and they are always so important!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1938;I'll get around to it eventually;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1939;Work on your epic poem has progressed quickly as of late. You've experienced a significant breakthrough, and the words flow from your pen like...things flowing from a something that flows...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1939;I'm pretty good at this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1940;Finally, after much work and toil, you've finally completed your epic poem. The beauty of it is sublime, the imagery innovative and story is inspiring.  You can't wait to recite it before the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1940;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1941;The renowned poet, [Root.GetTitledName], has evidently completed another masterpiece of Islamic literature. It is said that he stood and read it before the court...and the reaction was mixed and unenthusiastic. There are some who say this work will be remembered in time for its greatness, but for now [Root.GetTitledFirstName] appears to mostly be embarrassed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1941;Aargh! All that work, and for what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1942;The renowned poet, [Root.GetTitledName], has evidently completed another masterpiece of Islamic literature. It is said that he stood and read it before the court...and the reaction was astounding. Men wept tears of joy and women swooned. The work has immediately gained popularity throughout Muslim lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_1949;All those long weeks and months spent studying the Holy Qur'an in order to grasp its secrets, and yet you feel further away from the truth now then when you started. Could all this be just a waste of time?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1950;Your carnal desires have only served to distract you from your true calling: unlocking the secrets of the Holy Qur'an. Indeed, you've barely touched another person during these last months of study. Perhaps it would be best to avoid them altogether?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_Plus_1959;Fazlallah Astarabadi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1959;A radical Muslim preacher and mystic, Fazlallah Astarabadi, has been spreading his kabbalistic Shia heresy all over [hurufi_province.GetName] and the surrounding provinces, drawing great crowds and many disciples. At first he was ignored as just another itinerant madman, but his secular power has grown enough that he can no longer be ignored. The question is now whether his doctrine has any merit to [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], the ruling [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], or whether the heresy will be combated as any other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1959;I believe his words ring of truth;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1959;This heresy must be stamped out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1959;He is a great Hurufi scholar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1959;Such a perversion of Allah's wisdom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1962_found;The schism at the heart of Islam dates back to its earliest days. The majority Sunnis have long persecuted the followers of Ali, the Shias, forcing them into hiding. The partisans of Ali look to his descendants for leadership, but they are forced to keep their ancestry secret. Now though, the Shias are mobilizing their strength behind a young man by the name of [shiite_revolter.GetFirstName] whom they claim to be Ali's rightful heir and Imam. Other Islamic jurists claim that the boy is clearly a fraud, but to his followers he is the one they have been waiting for and now they flock to his banner as he begins his crusade to wrest the [shiite_revolt_target_title.GetFullName] from the hands of [shiite_revolt_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Now, however, the Shias are mobilizing their strength behind Imam [shiite_revolter.GetFirstName] -- descendant of Muhummad through his daughter, Fatimah, who has abdicated his title as the [abdicated_title.GetRulerTitle] of [abdicated_title.GetName] in order to lead his faithful against [shiite_revolt_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] for control over the [shiite_revolt_target_title.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_1963;With your assumption of the Shiite caliphate, Shiite faithful from across many realms have flocked to [Root.Capital.GetName] to fight under your banner.

EVTDESC_Plus_1965;Your actions have proven you worthy of deeper initiation into the secret rites of the Druze. It is considered a great honor to join this elite group of religious leaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1965;I have been waiting for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1965;I am not interested;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_1966;'I, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], being sane of spirit and body and duly qualified, attest on my soul, without compulsion or constraint, that I renounce all the different cults, religions, and creeds and acknowledge nothing other than obedience to our Lord al-Hakim, revered be his name, and obedience is worship;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_1968;With the ascendance of [Root.GetTitledName] to the rank of Shaykh, the Druze have been given an unprecedented spokes[Root.GetManWoman]. They are no longer the small and oft-maligned group of heretics, but a force that has arrived on the world stage of equal worth to the religions around them. Indeed, they are not truly a Muslim sect, and do not consider themselves such, and with [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] at their head they are now considered a faith in their own right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_Plus_1968;They are still heretics in the eyes of Allah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
