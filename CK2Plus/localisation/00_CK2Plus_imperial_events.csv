EVTDESC_Plus_1861A;Rulers throughout the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] are pleased by [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s cleverness in ruling the empire. [Root.GetHerHis] commands have been unusual, but in the end they almost always prove to be the correct path.

EVTDESC_Plus_1863;As [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] lies in [Root.GetHerHis] bed, largely unaware of what goes on throughout [Root.GetHerHis] empire, there is growing concern over what this means for the future of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].

EVTDESC_Plus_1867A;Rulers throughout the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] are becoming increasingly concerned by [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s strange melancholy.

EVTOPTA_Plus_1871;[From.GetSheHeCap] can have my old empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
