EVTDESC_Plus_100;I have decided to pardon [From.GetTitledName] of all [From.GetHerHis] crimes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_100;Mercy is a virtue;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_100;Eh, never mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_105;I have decided to grant estates and land to [From.GetFullName], but how much land will [From.GetSheHe] receive?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_105;A minor estate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_105;A moderate estate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_105;A large estate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_105;None at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_107;Today, my [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] asked me for landed estates to live off...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_107;I gave [From.GetHerHim] what [From.GetSheHe] wanted;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_107;I told [From.GetHerHim] I could not afford it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_109;I have arranged for the sale of my old estates so that I can concentrate my wealth to the lands that I now hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_115;A claim on a title has been discovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_116;I have learned that [From.GetTitledName] has laid claim to one of my titles on the grounds of ancestral inheritance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_116;[From.GetSheHeCap] better not try anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_120;I have ruled long enough, and my health is no longer what it once was. Perhaps the time has come to pass my titles onto my heir?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_120;Yes, it is time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_120;No, not just yet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_121;[From.GetTitledName] has decided to voluntarily abdicate [From.GetHerHis] rule, citing poor health and other concerns. [From.GetHerHisCap] titles have been passed onto me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_121;[From.GetSheHeCap] will surely be missed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_126;Even though you have been trying to conceive a child with your husband, it simply hasn't happened... and you are beginning to suspect you might be barren. Some of the maids have whispered that there are things which can be done to remedy this, although they are not entirely without risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_126;I don't care about the risk! I want a child!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_126;I will put my faith in [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_126;[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] will get no child from me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_127;For some time now, your councilors have made their suspicions known that [barren_wife.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is, in fact, barren. You've denied it, certain that the two of you would have a child before long... but perhaps they are right? Worse, you believe she knows the truth and has said nothing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_127;How could this have happened?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_130;The [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] is not a realm where all power is rooted in the [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], and thus it does not seem right that [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] should hold so many crowns. Perhaps the [Root.Capital.Kingdom.GetFullName] needs a new ruler?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_130;Demand [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] grant [Root.Capital.Kingdom.GetName] to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_130;[Root.Liege.GetSheHeCap] has enough problems, I'm certain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_131;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] is not a realm where all power resides in the hands of the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], and the consensus appears to be that I hold too many titles myself. Thus it is no surprise that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has demanded the crown of [From.Capital.Kingdom.GetName] be granted to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_131;Give [From.GetHerHim] the crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_131;I will give it to one of my children instead;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_131;The crown will go to someone in line for the title;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_131;I will give it to someone with a claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_131;How dare [From.GetSheHe] even ask! The crown is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_132;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nKnow that I consider you even asking me to surrender the crown of [Root.Capital.Kingdom.GetName] to be impertinent. My titles are mine to keep, and I will kindly ask you to remember your place.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_132;Impertinent? How dare [From.GetSheHe]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_133;Dear [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nWhile your argument regarding the need for the crown of [Root.Capital.Kingdom.GetName] to not rest in my hands seems valid, know that I have decided to give it to another. I trust you will show them the same loyalty and consideration you have always shown me.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_133;The crown should have been mine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_135;[Root.Liege.GetTitledName] has declared an Antipope, [Root.RelHead.GetTitledName], in opposition to the true Pope. As a good [Root.Religion.GetName], I should consider whether I support [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] in [Root.Liege.GetHerHis] actions, or whether I believe [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] has done nothing more than undermine the authority of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_135;I support [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_135;I support the true Pope;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_135;I don't care who the Pope is, to be perfectly frank;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_140;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] has decided to set you aside. As of this moment, by the laws of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith, you are no longer married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_140;That bitch! How dare she!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_140;That bastard! How dare he!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_141;News has reached you that [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName] has decided to set aside your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]. According to the laws of the [FromFromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith, the two are no longer married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_142;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has decided to establish a cadet branch of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty. From now on, he and all his descendants will be known as the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_143;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], has decided to establish a cadet branch of the [old_dynasty_head.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty. From now on, he and all his descendants will be known as the [From.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_144;It is no longer enough for me to be a member of the [old_dynasty_head.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty. That legacy belongs to my elder brother, while I was expected for lesser things. Now that I am the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], it is time to establish a legacy in my own name. From now on, my descendants and I will be known as the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_144;My accomplishments will be my own;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_145;The [old_dynasty_head.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], the [old_dynasty_head.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty has become decadent, and Allah would not look favorably upon it. From now on, my descendants and I will be known as the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty, and we shall establish a new chapter in the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_146;The time has come to break away from my relatives in the [old_dynasty_head.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty. As the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], I hereby declare that my descendants shall be part of the [Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] dynasty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_1751;While [Root.GetKingQueen] [Root.GetFirstNameWithNick] has recently inherited the throne of [FromFrom.GetName], to most this means little as no [FromFrom.GetAdjective] land is actually part of [Root.GetHerHis] realm. [Root.GetFirstName] claims the title, it's true, but the [FromFrom.GetAdjective] crown has effectively been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1751;The [FromFrom.GetAdjective] Crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1751;No! [FromFrom.GetName] shall be mine again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1752;§RWARNING!§!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1752;You are currently playing Crusader Kings with the §RIronman§! game setting. While the CK2+ mod does function in Ironman, there are enough odd issues with the mode that we don't recommend it.\n\nContinue at your own risk! If you encounter issues, DO NOT REPORT THEM ON THE PARADOX FORUMS. If you absolutely must, tell us that you're using the mode, but be aware that it's very likely there is nothing we can do about it. The issues with Ironman are intrinsic to the mode itself, and not moddable. Got it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1752;I understand;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1756;[new_title.GetFullName] was re-assigned to [new_owner.GetBestName] -- needs to be checked out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1759;[reassigned_vassal.GetBestName] was too distant a vassal from [old_liege.GetBestName], and thus was re-assigned as vassal to [new_liege.GetBestName] -- needs to be checked out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_1763;It seems I have an opportunity to acquire a different education. But this will be at a significant cost, will take several years, and may reduce my current education tier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1763;I need different skills!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1763;I want to be better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1764;Which education would be most helpful to have? Let's see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1764;Diplomacy is the key to the future;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1764;I must become a warrior;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1764;I will master the numbers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1764;Learn to rule from the shadows;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_1764;Faith is all that matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1765;Success of my re-education will depend on how much I'm going to invest in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1765;I want the best education money can buy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1765;I will spend moderately;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1765;Anything is better than what I have now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1768;A new court educator [new_educator.GetBestName] has arrived at my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1772;Finally! I have finished my re-education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1773;I have trouble retaining everything I learn and it's becoming more and more difficult to follow the lessons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1773;Persist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1773;Take it easy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1774;A heated debate with my educator somehow got out of hand and we turned to insults.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1774;Try to talk with them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1774;My word is final!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1775;A new book was recently published, and it may benefit my education.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1775;This is exactly what I need;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1775;Aren't all books the same?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1776;I've discovered an ancient dusty tome in my library. If I study it, I'm sure I will impress the court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1776;Spend the night studying;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1776;I'll rather get some sleep;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1777;My lover [Root.Lover.GetFirstName] is free tonight, but if I spend time with [Root.Lover.GetHerHim] I will fall behind on my lessons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1777;Education is more important;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1777;Love comes first;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_Plus_1764;My current educator has exactly what I need;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTG_Plus_1764;I want to hire a different educator;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_Plus_1800;Say My Name;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1800;After clicking OK, you will get a duchy level title named after your character. Simply rename the title and then right-click on the title shield and select Rename Character decision. If no action is take, this title will self-destruct after 7 days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_1806;A messenger has delivered you a letter from Prince [random_hausa_name.GetFirstName]. It tells a story of how after his father died his uncle usurped the throne. Fearing for his life, the prince had no choice but to escape. However, before escaping he managed to hide a significant amount of treasure at a secret room in the palace. He seems to want my help to get it back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1815;You've been worrying about the fate of Prince [random_hausa_name.GetFirstName] for weeks now. But one morning, your messenger brings you a new letter from the prince.\nHe says that the plan worked, and he managed to get every single coin out. He's very grateful and has also sent back the money you've loand him, plus a little extra... A big extra.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1806;How terrible, I must help him immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1806;What a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1806;Such nonsense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1807;After a few weeks, another letter from Prince [random_hausa_name.GetFirstName] has arrived. He goes further into details of his story. He also mentions other family members that managed to escape and are now in the hiding throughout the realm. In the end he asks you to send a certain amount of money to him so he can bribe the palace guards and allow him to take back his wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1807;Send the money immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1807;I'm not falling for that;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1808;As you wake up one morning, you have a sudden realization. There was no prince, it was a scam!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1808;Easy come, easy go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1808;Someone around here can surely help me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1809;It seems my 'brilliant' liege has lost some money on a scam. And now it's my job to find someone to blame.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1809;Blame it on a random rich landowner;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1809;I already know who did it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1810;Your spymaster has informed you that one of the farm owners near your capital was actually the 'prince'. He has already been executed, but not all of the money was found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1811;Your spymaster enters victoriously to your throneroom and presents you his prisoner, the 'Prince' [nigerian_prince.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1814;Your spymaster enters your throneroom and informs you that your rival [nigerian_prince.GetBestName] is to be blamed for your misfortune.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1812;It appears that your rival [wealthy_target.GetBestName] believed every word from the letter you had sent him in the name of 'prince' [random_hausa_name.GetBestName]. Now you just have to get [wealthy_target.GetHerHim] to send some money to the 'poor, unfortunate prince'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1813;That imbecile, [wealthy_target.GetBestName] actually paid the huge amount your requested as help. You probably could've asked for more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1816;My rival [From.GetBestName] figured out the Princely scheme. [From.GetSheHeCap] backed out in the last minute and decided not to send me the money. Fortunately, [From.GetSheHe] has no idea who actually sent [From.GetHerHim] the letter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
