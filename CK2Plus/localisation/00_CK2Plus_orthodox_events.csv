EVTNAME_Plus_2100;Acheiropoieta;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2100;Above the gate to a city in [acheiropoieta_province.GetName], there is enshrined an Acheiropoieta: an icon which, it is claimed, was not created by human hands but rather came into existence miraculously. All icons in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are condemned to be destroyed, but the people of [acheiropoieta_province.GetName] have refused to destroy the Acheiropoieta, claiming its divine heritage shelters the city from danger. [iconoclast_patriarch.GetTitledName] has, however, demanded you deal it regardless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2100;Send soldiers to destroy it immediately;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2100;Let them have their false icon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2100;Take it and keep it for yourself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2101;You still have the acheiropoieta you took so long ago from the city in [acheiropoieta_province.GetName]. You keep it in a secluded shrine that only you have access to. Lately, as you go to visit it, you hear voices in your head, telling you things, things confusing your mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2101;It really is divine! Icons are real!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2101;It is [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName] trying to destroy me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2102;Constantine's Return;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2102;The war is not going well, and many parts of the empire are already in chaos. Now, a group of soldiers has reportedly broken into the imperial mausoleum in the Church of the Holy Apostles, opened the sarcophagus of Constantine V, and implored him to return and save the empire. Iconoclast zealots have been quick to jump on this news, claiming it is Orthodox idolatry that is dooming the emperor. They have pleaded with [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] to honor the memory of the former emperor and lead the emperor away from its idolatrous ways before it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2102;They are right -- the idolatry must end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2102;That is not why we are losing the war;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2102;This does not bode well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2103;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has embraced the iconoclast heresy, demanding that all holy icons be destroyed and all subjects of the empire convert as [From.GetSheHe] has.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2103;Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2103;[From.GetSheHeCap] is a fool and a heretic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2103;Finally an [From.PrimaryTitle.GetTitledName] with sense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2103;This is of no concern to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2105;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2105;While the Paulician faith has been riven by internal conflicts for the last few decades, the heresy has a new leader in [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], a zealous priest of [Root.Culture.GetName] origin as well as an effective converter. He has spread his sect throughout Armenian lands ruled by the Byzantine Empire, and is very quickly becoming a major problem for Orthodox rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2105;Blasted heretics!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2106;All across the Byzantine Empire, Paulicians are being violently persecuted on the order of [Root.GetTitledName]. They are rounded up and imprisoned, their homes burned and their belongings seized. All Paulician courtiers have been ordered either executed or banished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2106;Hopefully that will take care of it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2106;A rather extreme measure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2106;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2107;The Paulician Patriarch;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2107;[Root.GetTitledName] has claimed the title of Paulician Patriarch, head of all Christians who follow the teachings of Paul of Samosata. Others outside of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] claim the [Root.GetManWoman] is little more than a glorified warlord, but to the Paulician faithful [Root.GetSheHe] is a symbol of their victory against attempts by their fellow Christians to suppress them. Perhaps, in time, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will lead the Paulicians to claiming a piece of history in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2107;A glorious day for us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2107;Who is this upstart heretic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2107;A self-titled warmonger? How very Christian...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2110;Bogomilists in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2110;A heresiarch by the name of 'Bogomil', which may not even be his true name, has appeared in the province of Tyrnovo, capitalizing on the anger of the locals following their conversion from pagan ways. His teachings of a heresy that seems to combine Christianity with a combination of Gnostic dualism and anti-church sentiment has caught on extremely quickly in both Tyrnovo and the surrounding areas, presenting a challenge to [Root.GetTitledName]'s rule as well as to the authority of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Some believe that this 'Bogomil' has reached the court of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and that [Root.GetSheHe] might even be considered a conversion to these heretical beliefs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2110;I believe this priest has wise things to say;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2110;Me, convert? To a foul heresy?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2110;Hurrah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2110;This does not bode well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2112;The formalization process of Bogomilism has officially begun, with [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] meeting with a group of perfecti leaders in [Root.Capital.GetName] and expressing [Root.GetHerHis] desire to see the faith go from a disorganized movement to one fully integrated with [Root.GetHerHis] rule. They expressed doubt, but were willing to hear [Root.GetHerHim] out, for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2112;We will all have to be patient;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2113_religion;All this talk of 'reforming' the Bogomilist faith in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] is pointless. Perhaps the previous rulers were interested in such a thing, but since you are not a Bogomilist, you will certainly have no part in it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2113_rule;While you would gladly continue the process of reforming the Bogomilist faith, you no longer have the influence to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2114;[Root.GetTitledName]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded after a recent meeting of Perfecti in [Root.Capital.GetName]. They finally agreed to a common liturgy, so that ceremonies performed across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] use a common set of prayers and rituals, and that this will be taught to new Perfecti going forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2115;Up until now, Bogomilist priests have all used different letters and gospels in their preaching, a result of the scattered and disparate beginnings of the faith. At the behest of [Root.GetTitledName], the '[Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] Bible' has been written and agred upon as canon by a council of Perfecti in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2116;In order to continue the process of formalizing the Bogomilist faith, the scattered preachers and Perfecti will need to be gathered together in councils. They resist such efforts an organization, however, and the only way to see it done will be with coin -- for the poor, for shrines, for bribes, and for God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2116;If that is what it takes, so be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2116;I will not bribe my faith into reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2117;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded after an unprecedented agreement from Bogomilist leaders across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] to gather in permanent councils sponsored by the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2117;A good day for all Bogomilists;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2118;A Bogomilist Perfecti has approached you with an idea for continuing your efforts to formalize your faith: the construction of several seminary schools across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], each teaching a common and unified version of Bogomilism dogma to future preachers. It would be expensive, but the Perfecti says it would be a worthy achievement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2118;An excellent idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2118;Not right now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2119;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have advanced, with the construction of numerous seminary schools across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] that would each train new priests in a standardized form of dogma.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2120;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded today after a prominent Perfecti in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] issued a proclamation of support. The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] is a [Root.GetManWoman] of piety and faith, he says, and thus [Root.GetHerHis] desires should be heeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2121;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomilist faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have advanced after the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] gave a speech in [Root.Capital.GetName] that has been widely-disseminated and complimented by pious scholars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2122;A recent treatise written by [Root.GetTitledName] [Root.GetHerHim]self on the vital importance of Bogomilism's continued reforms has spread far and wide across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and received a lot of recognition from the faithful as being full of wisdom. Indeed, some are viewing the text as a new addition to Bogomilist canon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2123;Recently, a new sect of Bogomilist has been spreading in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], one that advocates a radically different version of the faith. Normally this would not be an issue, as the sect is not popular, but it has proven disruptive to your efforts to formalize Bogomilism, as their presence has prompted other sects to follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2123;Leave them be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2123;Quietly get rid of them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2124;A recent revival of Bogomilist traditionalism has taken hold in [PrimaryTitle.GetName], with numerous preachers cropping up who actively deride your efforts to reform the faith as being exactly the same sort of tyrannical structure they rebelled against in the first place. Needless to say, this has not been helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2125;A prominent Perfecti in [demand_province.GetName] has publicly begged that you slow down, if not outright stop, the process of Bogomilist reform. The common folk are confused by these contradictions, he says, and continuing down this path too quickly will only bring down God's wrath. The Perfecti is too popular to be silenced, as doing so would turn him into a martyr for his cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2125;Do as he asks, for now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2125;Ignore him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2126;A set of crop failures and other disasters that has fallen one of your provinces in recent months has stirred the ire of several fiery preaches in the area. They say that you are to blame, that your desire for reforms and general lack of piety is what has brought down God's wrath upon the people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. Sadly, their words have taken hold amongst many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2127;A prominent Perfecti has recently taken issue with your desire to reform the Bogomilist faith, pointing out a number of flaws in your argument without ever actually saying outright that your intention is solely to grab power and force the faithful into compliance. To her, you are not a learned enough [Root.GetManWoman] to push such things forward, and there is no convincing her otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2128;[Root.GetTitledName]'s recent victory against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a major victory for Bogomilism, and has spread the notion that perhaps the continuing reforms of the faith have God's favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2129;[Root.GetTitledName]'s recent staggering loss against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a sign that the ongoing reforms of the Bogomilist faith do not have God's favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2130;Bogomilist Faith Organized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2130;In its inception, the Bogomilist faith was only loosely organized. It didn't believe in formal churches, and opposed any kind of formal hierarchy -- this has all changed with the leadership of [Root.GetTitledName], whose piety and status as a Perfecti has encouraged all members of [Root.GetHerHis] faith to reconsider their resistance to feudal structures. Bogomilists across the world are now more formally organized, though many still do not consider them a true religion, and they remain opposed to any kind of formal church that emulates the Orthodox priesthood. Even so, there are many that object to even these changes, saying that Bogomilism has betrayed its own roots at a powerful [Root.GetLordLady]'s behest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2130;A better day for us all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2131;Bogomilist Faith Formalized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2131;Though the faithful were hardly ready for it, Bogomilism has now been formalized as a structured religion thanks to the leadership of [Root.GetTitledName]. While many see [Root.GetHerHis] leadership and piety as being worthwhile to follow, there are many who claim [Root.GetSheHe] has dragged the faith too fast into something which too much resembles the very kind of tyrannical structures they once abandoned. Preachers throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are questioning how far this will go, and whether the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] has not perhaps betrayed Bogomilism's principles for the sake of power. Whatever the case, Bogomilist priests are now unified under a common liturgy, a single sacred text, and operate out of temples -- far more than the disparate heretics from where they sprang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2131;This is how it must be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2131;Are we truly ready for this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2132;After a long and arduous process of reform, the Bogomilist faith can now truly be considered a formal religion. Under the considered leadership and piety of [Root.GetTitledName], Bogomilist priests are now unified under a common liturgy, a single sacred text, and operate out of temples -- far more than the disparate heretics from where they sprang. While some question whether these reforms betray the principles upon which Bogomilism was founded, far more say they were agreed to by all and with due consideration. The faith is now ready to come into its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_Plus_2134;The Bogomilist Patriarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2134;At the behest of [Root.GetTitledName], [new_bogomilist_patriarch.GetTitledName] has been elected as the head of the newly-founded Bogomilist Church, Bogomilism having completely transformed itself from an Orthodox heresy into a fully-formed religion in its own right. Christian leaders elsewhere have been forced to recognize this new faith as a force in its own right, and its inception as a schism from standard Christianity rather than a true heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2134;It appears we must accept this now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2134;Heretics or not, they are still Christians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2135;Construction has begun in Tyrnovo on the planned Church of St. Bogomil, a structure to rival St. Peter's Basilica or the Hagia Sophia. It will surely be a marvel of construction, and a bastion of faith for all Bogomilists across the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2135;Let us hope I live to see it finished;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2137;The Church of St. Bogomil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2137;As evidence of just how far the Bogomilist faith has come, the Church of St. Bogomil has completed construction in the city of Tyrnovo. A majestic structure to rival even the most potent Christian cathedrals, the church has become a bastion of faith for all Bogomilists across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2137;St. Bogomil himself would be pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BOGO_BEGIN_FORMALIZATION;Begin the formalization process of the Bogomilist faith. Note that this may take up to decades, though seeing it through to the end will ensure that formalization does not also come with massive upheaval amongst the faithful.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BOGO_FORMALIZATION0;Bogomilism is still nowhere near ready for formalization, and is further away from that goal than when the process began.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BOGO_FORMALIZATION1;Bogomilism is now a long way from being ready for peaceful formalization.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BOGO_FORMALIZATION2;Bogomilism is now about half-way to being ready for peaceful formalization.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BOGO_FORMALIZATION3;Bogomilism is now close to being ready for peaceful formalization.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BOGO_FORMALIZATION4;Bogomilism is now ready to be peacefully formalized.\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BOGO_ORGANIZED_TEN_YEARS;Bogomilism has been organized for at least ten years\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BOGO_READY_TO_FORMALIZE;Bogomilism is ready to formalize without resistance\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
