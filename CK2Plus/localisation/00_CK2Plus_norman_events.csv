EVTNAME_Plus_2751;The Invasion of Neustria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2751;A Viking warrior by the name of Rollo has collected a rather large band of followers over his years as a raider in the North Sea, and now rumor has it that he has set his sights on the northern coast of Neustria. Already citizens in the city of Rouen are panicking, fearing the imminent arrival of these barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2751_immediate;A Viking warrior by the name of Rollo has collected a rather large band of followers over his years as a raider in the North Sea, and now he has landed upon the northern coast of Neustria and seized several of its castles and cities. Many fear this Norseman will use Rouen as a base from which to launch further raids and thus terrorize the entirety of northern Francia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2751;Glory for the Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2751;They're coming *here*?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2753;Ruling in a strange land has been difficult, but the longer you remain in [Root.Capital.GetName] the more you hear about this Christian God and His ways. Considering that, more and more, your court is beginning to take on the language and mannerisms of the Franks, perhaps it would be easier to accept this new religion than fight against it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2753;I shall embrace this new God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2753;Never! My faith in Odin is absolute!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2754;The war is not going well. Those within your war council have uneasily advised that perhaps the best route would be to kneel before [christian_liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and offer to accept the Christian faith. To not do so might mean the loss of everything you've attempted to build in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2754;I will bend knee before this [christian_liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2754;Bend the knee? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2755;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am not a fool. You will win this war in time, but I have a better solution: I offer my soldiers and my loyalty. I will bend the knee as your vassal and accept your [Root.Religion.GetName] faith as my own, if you will but spare my life and that of my court.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2755_prisoner;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI am your prisoner, and you may do with me what you wish -- but I offer you a better solution: my soldiers and my loyalty. I will bend the knee as your vassal and accept your [Root.Religion.GetName] faith as my own, if you will but spare my life and that of my court.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2755;If he bends the knee, he may live;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2755;No -- the war continues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2756;[Root.GetFirstName] Surrenders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2756;Facing an ignominious loss in his war against the Christians, [Root.GetTitledName] has bent the knee to [From.GetTitledName] and converted to the Christian faith. In truth, there are many who say the Norsemen of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] have already taken on the language and customs of the Franks, and that this embracing of a new culture and liege was simply making official what was already in truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2756;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2756;So long as he is loyal, I am pleased;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2757;There shall be no peace so long as you remain squatting on land where you do not belong.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2758;Now that you have converted, you are finally free to marry Poppa -- a consort captured at Bayeaux, and who you have been speaking with on matters of Christ for some time. Additionally, she has now born you a son and heir!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DEFENDER_KNEELS;§Y[This.GetBestName]§! will convert to the [Root.Religion.GetName] and become your vassal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
OFFER_TO_KNEEL;Offer to become [This.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s vassal and accept [This.GetHerHis] faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
