EVTDESC_GoPagan_100;For quite some time now you have watched the steady decline of the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion. You listen to the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle]s as they read from the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], and you can't help but wonder if they haven't lost their way.

EVTNAME_GoPagan_125;In Search of Ancient Knowledge;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_125;As you delve into the realm of manuscripts and dusty tomes, it comes to your attention that there is a great deal of knowledge to be found in the past -- knowledge that [Root.Religion.GetName] scholars might consider forbidden even though it is the legacy of your ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
