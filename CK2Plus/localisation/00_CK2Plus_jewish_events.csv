EVTOPTA706;G'mar Hatima Tova!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA712;Yes, I will thus draw nearer to Hashem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x


EVTDESC_Plus_700;The Jewish Community that I am sheltering has prospered and grown under my benevolent rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_701;My liege, I bring news from the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName]. The Jewish merchants that you wisely allowed to settle in the city have grown fat and prosperous under your benevolent rule, and you can expect increased revenue from the taxes and tariffs imposed on their community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_703;A skilled advisor from the Jewish Community I am sheltering has made his services available to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_704;A group of Jewish refugees from distant lands have come to my court. They are seeking a new a place to live after being expelled from their former homes and ask for my permission to establish a community in one of my cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_704;They are welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_704;Tell them to move on;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_705;[From.GetTitledName] has decreed that all Jews in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are to be expelled from the realm and their assets seized by the crown. This includes my own Jewish subjects, who I have no choice but to banish unless I want to openly defy my liege.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_705;Bow to [From.GetHerHis] demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_705;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_706;The holy fast of Yom Kippur is soon upon us and all faithful Jews, save the infirm and those on a journey, must observe the fast during a 25 hour period after the Seudah Mafseket.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_707;The fast and observance of the holy day of Yom Kippur has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_708;Yom Kippur approaches and that means the Seudah Mafseket is soon upon us. The preparations for the planned feast to celebrate this have already been made and now the time has come to invite your vassals to your palace. What say you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_709;To celebrate Yom Kippur perhaps you should present a gift to your beloved wife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_710;Yom Kippur is a blessed time for charity and kindness and in that spirit you could release the prisoners languishing in your dungeons...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_711;Hashem teaches the importance of charity and good deeds. There are many poor in [Root.Location.GetName] who could be helped if you but parted with some of your treasury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_712;Now is the time for prayers and devoted reading of the Torah. After the sun has set, you could recite the Kol Nidre at the evening service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_713;The fast you have observed during Yom Kippur has taught you the value of moderation in all things and the dangers of indulgence and excess. You feel closer to Hashem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_714;You have given generously to the poor during Yom Kippur and performed many good deeds. The urge to help those in need comes naturally to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_716;To [GetFromRootCompliment] [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nI give thanks for your invitation to celebrate Yom Kippur at your palace, but I regret to inform you I cannot attend.\n\nYour servant,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_PLUS_717;Seudah Mafseket is held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_717;The great banquet you ordered held to celebrate the start of Yom Kippur was a rousing success! The food was exceptional, the entertainment magnificent and a great time was had by all. Your guests seemed suitably impressed by your wealth and generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_PLUS_718;Seudah Mafseket is attended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_718;The great banquet held by [From.GetTitledName] to celebrate the start of Yom Kippur was a splendid occasion. The food was exceptional, the entertainment magnificent and a great time was had by all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_719;To [Root.GetTitledName]. The start of Yom Kippur draws nea, and to celebrate I have decided to hold a great feast in my palace. You are of course invited.\n\nWith respect,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_722;Though the fast requires you to abstain from food and drink you helped yourself to enough wine to fall into a drunken stupor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_723;Many in [Root.Location.GetName] have donated generously to provide for the poor during as a result of Yom Kippur. The gold has been gathered in an urn but when you approach it to donate your own share, your greedy nature results in your coin purse gaining weight instead of losing it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_724;As a cynical unbeliever you do your best to uphold the appearance of observing the fast but behind closed doors you do not think twice about eating and drinking to your heart's content. Despite your best attempts however you are caught in the act...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_725;While the majority of [From.GetName] has converted away from [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] there is still a noticeable minority presence in the province. What should be done with the last few that refuse to convert?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTAPlus_725;Leave them be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTBPlus_725;Ease their concerns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTCPlus_725;Threaten the rest out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
