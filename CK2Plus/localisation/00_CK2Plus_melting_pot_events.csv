EVTDESC_Plus_670;For as long as we have ruled here in [Root.Capital.GetName], we have entrusted the raising of our children to local nursemaids. Our first words would not be [Root.Culture.GetName] but [melting_pot_province.Culture.GetName]. As we grew up, we learned to speak a tongue that was neither one nor the other but a syncretic mix of the two. Perhaps it is time to embrace this new tongue so we all may communicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_671;It seems that this new [new_culture.Culture.GetName] language has now spread into [Root.GetName], a new culture born from a mix of the old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_672;Although many dislike change, this new [Root.Culture.GetName] language does have a certain functionality that cannot be denied. I have therefore prevailed upon a member of my court to adopt this for everyday administrative use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_686;For a long time has our language been different from that of our Slavic brothers and the language of our ancestors. Perhaps it is time to embrace this new tongue so we all may communicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_687;It seems like our [new_culture.Culture.GetName] language has now spread into [Root.GetName], a new culture born from the old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_689;It seems like our new Bön religion has now spread into [Root.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_663;The Germanic people have a long history going as far back as even the Romans themselves during their height of power. A language and culture most similar to each other was not entirely uncommon to see, until more recent time. It would seem these 'Germans' are beginning to identify themselves as more distinct from each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_681;For as long as we have lived as refugees we spoke the tongue of old only in secret. This has begun changing as now that we no longer need to hide ourselves from those who would persecute us based on our beliefs. As we grew up, we returned to speaking our common tongue of Hebrew. Perhaps it is time to once again embrace this tongue so that we all may communicate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_682;It seems that the old Hebrew language has now returned to majority use in [Root.GetName], and with it a new culture born from a mix of the old and new ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_683;Having fled to all corners of the world the Jewish people adopted various local languages but we've always had one common tongue, Hebrew. I have therefore prevailed upon a member of my court to adopt this for everyday administrative use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_Plus_684;For centuries has our religious identity mixed with ideas from surrounding Buddhist lands. This has resulted with our customs and beliefs changing over time, and creating something new that can no longer be called [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
