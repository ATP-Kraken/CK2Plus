EVTDESC_Plus_1100;Your council gathers as you inform them of your decision to disinherit [From.GetTitledFirstName]. While the reasoning is obvious to everyone, their somber faces betray the fact this is not something to be lightly considered. [From.GetFirstName] could take up arms against you, after all, and many of your vassals would consider [From.GetHerHis] position completely justified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1100;I have considered the matter carefully—let it be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1100;I doubt [From.GetSheHe] will even understand what has happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1100;[From.GetSheHeCap] is in prison—what could [From.GetSheHe] do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1100;Perhaps not, then;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1101;News has spread throughout the realm that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has declared [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] unfit to inherit the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], even though the law of the land states that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] should. Everyone knows the reason, but many are saying it doesn't seem right that the law should be ignored... even by the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1101;Actually, [From.GetSheHe] IS the law;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1101;I feel for [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], but that is how it is;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1101;This is an outrage! [From.GetTitledFirstName] has no right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1105;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has declared you unfit to inherit [From.GetHerHis] titles, even though the laws of the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] say that I am. It is only [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s great prestige that allows this, although it is certain many of [From.GetHerHis] vassals would be sympathetic to your cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1105;Disappointing, but truly I am relieved;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1105;Look for support in dealing with this outrage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1105;I will become [From.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], no matter what [From.GetSheHe] says!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1106;My [Root.GetLordLady], I am certain you have heard the recent news regarding my disinheritance. I consider this an illegal act, and since I understand you to be sympathetic regarding my cause I will join your court while I consider my options. -- Yours in thanks, [From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1106;We are pleased to welcome [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1106;If [From.GetSheHe] must come here, then so be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1110;While you can barely understand in your current state, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has declared you unfit to inherit [From.GetHerHis] titles. People around you are talking about this, and some are angry, but it's simply too dizzying to think about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1110;Maybe it's for the best;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1115;Languishing in prison as you are, it's several days before you hear the news that [From.GetTitledFirstName] has declared you unfit to inherit [From.GetHerHis] titles, even though the laws of the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] say it should be so. As unsurprised as you are, you know there are those who would support you... if you could ever get out of here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1115;There will be a reckoning once I am free;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1120;The situation with [From.GetTitledFirstName] has changed, and perhaps the time has come for a reconciliation. It will not be easy, of course... your council hums and haws over the idea of you going back on your decree, as lingering bad feelings will persist regardless, but it is possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1120;He is my son--that is all that matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1120;She is my daughter--that is all that matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1120;Perhaps they are right;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1121;Some good news! The bad blood between [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has been settled, with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] being granted full inheritance rights once again... even if some are grumbling at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s arbitrary decrees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1121;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] should be pleased, at least;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1125;It appears the impossible has happened: [From.GetTitledFirstName] has decided to reconcile, and has decreed that you once again enjoy full inheritance rights in the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1131;With the recent death of [From.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] decree regarding your inheritance rights no longer applies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1131;[From.GetSheHeCap] will not be missed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
