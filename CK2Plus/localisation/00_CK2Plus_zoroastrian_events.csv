EVTDESC_GoPagan_201;A petition came today from your Muslim vassals to help them rebuild their mosque destroyed in a recent fire. Will you choose the path of tolerance chosen by many of the famous Zoroastrian Shahs of old, or will you ignore those not following the teachings of Zarathustra?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_GoPagan_203;Today your child, [From.GetTitledFirstName], partakes in a Sedreh Pushi, an initiation ceremony. [From.GetSheHeCap] will don a shirt (Sudreh), girdle (Kushti), and a covering for the head and begin a new life as a member of the Zoroastrian flock.

EVTDESC_GoPagan_205;You have decided to rebuild the capital of the ancient Persian empire, albeit in a slightly new location. You commission quarries to deliver large amounts of marble and gather masons from around the realm to build it. How ambitious should this project be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GoPagan_205;Make it even greater than it was!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_206;Persepolis Rebuilt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_206;The new city is almost complete. What do you want to work on as a great project to complete the city? You can rebuild the ancient library to further our scholars' work, you can reconstruct the irrigation system to allow you to support more troops, or you can rebuild the Gate of all nations to dazzle the emissaries from the peoples you subjugated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_206;Rebuild the library.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_206;Reconstruct the irrigation system.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GoPagan_206;Rebuild the Gate of All Nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_207;New Persepolis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_207;The task is complete. New Persepolis has been erected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_207;Our Empire will never fall again and the world will bathe in our splendor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_210;Persepolis is restored!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_210;The splendor of Persepolis has been restored many centuries after the destruction of the original in around 330 BC by Alexander the Great. In a new location, New Persepolis seeks to be the beacon of renewed hope at the heart of a new Persian Empire. Already many Persians are seeking to expand the borders of their reborn realm even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_210;Worrisome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_215;Immortal Once More;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_215;With the formation of the Persian kingdom, an old terror returns to the world. The Zhayedan (or, as they are more commonly known, Immortals) seek once again to strike fear into the hearts of the enemies of the Persians, as they did in centuries past when they numbered ten thousand strong. These elite units are comparable to the Greek cataphracts of their time and are equipped with only the finest of equipment and horses. Truly they are a force worthy of the world’s attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_216;A New Persian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_216;With the reformation of the Persian Empire and the growing of its borders, the Shahanshah has decided that a second force of Zhayedan elites will be required. It would be a grave mistake to underestimate the power of this resurgent Persian Empire, as no one can doubt their legitimacy at this point. But in what direction will their ambitions drive them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_220;The Great Sacrifice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_220;You feel the time is right to make a great sacrifice to one of the divinities of Zoroastrianism. As you begin to plan the event, you realize that you haven’t even decided on which divinity to sacrifice to. After some deliberation you decide to make a great sacrifice…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_220;... to Mithra, a divinity associated with war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_220;... to Parendi, a divinity associated with riches.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GoPagan_220;... to Chisti, a divinity associated with wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_GoPagan_220;... to none of them. It was a silly idea after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_225;The Cleansing Ritual;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_225;You approach a set of 6 holes about two feet deep for the ritual. The closest three are filled with gomez (consecrated bull’s urine, an effective ancient sanitizer). The furthest three are filled with water. There is a holy fire on the far end and you come to the realization that the priests are waiting for you to begin the ritual. As you recite Yasna 49 with the priests and approach the first gomez filled hole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_225;I praise Thee, O Mazda Ahura, in my hymns and expect enjoying what Thou deemest the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_226;Choosing the Shekhinah;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_226;The Manichaeans believed there were five 'Shekhinah', which are the elements where the Divine dwells. Each Manichaean can choose an element upon which to focus, and once chosen that focus cannot be changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_226;I will focus upon Haunâ, or Reason;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_226;I will focus upon Madde'â, or Mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GoPagan_226;I will focus upon Reyana, or Intelligence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_GoPagan_226;There are other Shekhinah to consider...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_227;I will focus upon Mahíabtâ, or Thought;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_227;I will focus upon Tar'îtâ, or Understanding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_228;The New Archegos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_228;After the Manichaean Archegos was murdered by the Caliph in Baghdad, many thought that was the end of the religion as an organized church. But like a phoenix rising from its ashes, [new_manichaean_leader.GetTitledName] has been proclaimed the new Archegos by [Root.GetTitledName], with the Manichaean faith having enough power now to make him no mere charlatan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_228;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_228;And so the heresy grows more powerful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_229;The Army of Light;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_229;The growing power of the Manichaeans can no longer be denied. With the aid of [Root.GetTitledName], a group of fanatics, peasants, and madmen have now banded together to create their own army, to smite heathens and infidels and to protect the righteous. They call themselves the Army of Light, and their holy mission is to fight for the cause of good -- in the eyes of the Manichaeans -- and drive darkness out of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_229;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_231;My [Root.GetLordLady], this extremely generous donation will not be forgotten. You have my friendship, as well as that of the Manichaean Church. Rest assured that you will be rewarded in the afterlife, if not on Earth!\nYours in faith,\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_233;My [Root.GetLordLady], this antagonism is completely unwarranted! The Army of Light serves [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], but, one has to wonder, do you?\n\nWith anger and sadness,\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_234;Religious leaders from the province of Baghdad are complaining about the prevalence of Manichaean worshippers. 'It is horrible that you can not walk down a street in Baghdad without tripping over half a dozen Manichaeans. Why should we let these infidels continue to live while they tempt others away from the true faith?' They are asking that something be done, lest this become an even greater problem in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_234;We shall crush the Archegos and his followers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_234;No, I will not attack the innocent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_235;Manichaeans Slaughtered;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_235;The province of Baghdad was once the center of the Manichaean faith, home to [manichaean_leader.GetTitledName] who is their leader. After complaints by [Root.Religion.GetName] worshippers, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has begun a slaughter of all Manichaeans in the region -- beginning with [manichaean_leader.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and so ravaging the population that the scholar Ibn al-Nadim reports only finding five remaining in the entire city after the pogrom was finished. The Manicheaean position of Archegos now lies empty, and looks to remain so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_235;An outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_235;So must it be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_236;After the battle is over, your soldiers hail the victory as a great triumph of the Army of Light over your foes, in service to the Army of Darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_236;[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] watches over us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_237;After the battle is over, your soldiers curse the defeat as a great triumph of the Army of Darkness over the Army of Light, and shiver in their sleep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_237;It is the work of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_238;You have begun preparations for the Bema Feast, to celebrate the life and death of the Prophet Mani. You send out messengers with invitations to your vassals, expecting all to come and honor [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_238;This year it will be very special!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_239;Dear vassal,\nI hereby invite you to attend the celebration of the Bema Feast at [From.Capital.GetName].\n\nYour Liege,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_239;Of course I will go!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_239;No, I will not attend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_240;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nAlas, I will not be able to attend the Bema Feast. I will offer thanks to Mani in a much more humble affair at [From.Capital.GetName], but I do appreciate your invitation.\n\nWith sincerity,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_240;The nerve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_241;Guests have arrived from villages throughout the realm, to celebrate the Bema Feast in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The festivities are almost ready to begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_242;Guests have arrived from villages throughout [Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName], to celebrate the Bema Feast in [Liege.Capital.GetName]. [Liege.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] greets you at the entrance to [Liege.GetHerHis] estate, and it seems the festivities are almost ready to begin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_243;The Bema Feast is over for now. Another celebration of Light to drive back the Darkness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_246;It is customary to fast in religious reflection before the start of the Bema Feast. Will you take part in this tradition?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_246;I will fast for a week;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_246;I will fast for the next three days;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GoPagan_246;Go without food? Perish the thought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_247;The Singing of Hymns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_247;The Bema Feast starts with the singing of various hymns that celebrate the return of spring, the life and death of the Prophet Mani, and the battles the Forces of Light have won over the Armies of Darkness. All those gathered raise their voices to the gods, a chorus of faith and beauty that touches the soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_247;This is my favorite part;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_250;The Feast of the Elect;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_250;Only the Elect -- those who are devoted to the Manichaean faith -- are invited to take part in a ritual meal, which both symbolizes the life of Mani and the theology of the Manichaeans. To take part is a great honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_250;Honor and Glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_251;The Presentation of the Arzhang;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_251;The Arzhang, or Picture Book, is a work painted by Mani himself, which depicts the Manichaean theology in simple terms, so that even the uneducated can read and understand the faith. The book rests on the bema until the feast is over, after which a priest recites sermons from it and absolves the sins of those attending.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_251;Praise be to [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_257;The Persian Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_257;It is said that the Abbasids would never have been able to seize the caliphate without the aid of the great Persian general, Abu Muslim, who in the end was rewarded for his service with death -- executed on the order of Caliph Al-Mansur. Resentment for this perceived betrayal has long simmered as resentment among the Persian people, resentment which has now broken out in open rebellion. A peasant leader by the name of Babak, aided by his capable wife Banu, an effective general and archer in her own right, has risen up to free his nation from the unjust rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]...and has already attracted a massive following, enough to present a real threat to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_257;This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_257;It's about time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_258;The Mazdaki Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_258;Although the Prophet Mazdak always railed against the corruption of the Zoroastrian Priesthood, and his followers have never had an official structure to speak of, now that the faith has risen to such prominence under [Root.GetTitledName] it seems the time has come to give it to them. With [new_mazdaki_leader.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] chosen as the new [new_mazdaki_leader.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of the [new_mazdaki_leader.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], the Mazdaki faith has entered a new era, with a priesthood rivalling that of the Zoroastrians from which they once stemmed...and have, perhaps, now exceeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_258;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_259;The Mazdaki teach there are four Powers that bring Light into the World: Discernment, Understanding, Preservation, and Joy. Any adult member of the faith may embrace one of these Powers. in an attempt to achieve eventual perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_259;I choose the Power of Discernment;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_259;I choose the Power of Understanding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GoPagan_259;I choose the Power of Preservation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_GoPagan_259;I choose the Power of Joy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_260;You have begun preparations for the Tawûsgeran festival, also known as the 'Circulation of the Peacock'. You send out messengers with invitations to your Yazidi vassals, expecting all to come and honor Melek Taus, greatest among the seven angels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_260;I've been looking forward to this;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_261;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\n\nThe time has come once again for us all to celebrate the Tawûsgeran, a time to honor Melek Taus - He who is most holy amongst the seven angels. The festival will take place in [From.Capital.GetName], and you are hereby formally invited to attend.\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_263;The Tawûsgeran festival is well under way when you finally arrive in [FromFrom.Capital.GetName]. Priests walk throughout the crowds, giving out vials of holy water to the faithful. You can hear the holy rites to the Seven being chanted at shrines everywhere you walk, though the name of Melek Taus is most prominent amongst them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_263;An excellent time, to be sure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_264;Peasants are streaming into [Root.Capital.GetName] from all over [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] for the beginning of the Tawûsgeran festival, and already your vassals are arriving. The chanting of rites to Melek Taus can be heard from the many shrines at your window, and soon the true celebrations will begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_265;The Circulation of the Peacock;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_265;The Circulation of the Peacock is about to start! In accordance with tradition, priests and pious men carry the senjaq, statues of the Seven Archangels, in circles around the city as they distribute blessings. To carry one of the statues is an honor reserved for only those of great wisdom and piety, as well as an event requiring considerable strength and willpower.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_265;I wish to carry one of the statues!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_265;I am content to watch the proceedings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_266;As you carry the heavy senjaq around, you discover that it is rather heavier than you expected. The unaccustomed weight causes you to stumble, and the idol slips out of your hands and crashes down to the ground and is damaged. Everyone stares in horror as you quickly pick it back up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_266;Only a few people saw that...right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_267;As you carry the heavy senjaq around, the weight and the heat begin to take their toll upon you. As if in a dream, you begin to hear the voices of the Seven Archangels talking, telling you secrets and mysteries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_267;They have visited me! I am blessed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_268;With each step of the Circulation, more and more of the truth of your faith is reveled to you. Of course this is the proper path. How could any man doubt such a truth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_268;For the glory of Menek Taus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_269;Perhaps it is the power of faith that fills you, but what once seemed so heavy at the beginning now feels as light as feather. Why, you could carry this senjaq around all day if the priests would let you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_269;Strength comes from faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_270;Veneration of the Senjaq;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_270;After the senjaq have been paraded around the city, the populace of the city comes forward to present their sacrifices and tributes. You visit each senjaq in turn, praying for the wisdom of the Seven Archangels, venerating them with holy incense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_270;For Wisdom and Honor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_271;Gifts From the Pious;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_271;The final stage of the Tawûsgeran festival is the collection of alms from the pious. Every man and woman is expected to give, a contribution to the greater faith and in support of those in need. While most give only a few coins, those who are able are expected to give much more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_271;I am a pious [Root.GetManWoman];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GoPagan_271;I will give what I must, no more;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GoPagan_271;Ignore this nonsense;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_272;The final ceremony is a grand sermon of thanksgiving to God and his servants. It was a rousing sermon as always, and the crowd begins the feast with great abandon. Another glorious celebration of the Seven Archangels has been completed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_272;Praise the Seven!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_273;The Tawûsgeran is over for now, and already the many decorations are being taken down. Melek Taus has been properly honored, and the realm is looking forward to a bright future under His wisdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_273;Until next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_277;Sadly, the death of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] means the Circulation of the Peacock must be canceled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_277;Such is how it is;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_GoPagan_278;A glorious day for us all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_279;The pilgrimage to Lalish, a site just outside of the bustling city of Mosul, is one of the most important journeys a Yazidi can undertake. There one attends the Feast of the Assembly, and returns filled with the spirit and strength of the Seven Archangels...or so the story goes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_280;The day has come. Your belongings are packed, arrangements have been made for matters in [Root.Capital.GetName] to be attended to while you are away, and your departure has been kept quiet to prevent the unsavory from taking advantage of your solitary journey. Now you must begin your journey to Lalish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_281;Arrival at Lalish;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_281;You arrive in the bustling city of holy Mosul, and it is not long before you make your way to Lalish, a mountain valley village not far to the north. This sleepy place is where the Yazidi faith truly began, and as the Feast of the Assembly unfolds, prayers offered to the Seven Archangels up in the heavens, you marvel at the conical roofs of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir's tomb. The rest of your stay will be spent in Mosul, but you cannot help but feel overcome at having taken a path so many have walked before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GoPagan_281;Now, what to do next?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_GoPagan_285;The Yazidi Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GoPagan_285;There are many who claim the Yazidi to be devil-worshippers, due to their veneration of the Peacock Angel they call Melek Taus or Shaytan.
