EVTDESC_Plus_5000;A group of peasants have brought a wealthy and influential merchant to your court, seeking justice against him for ‘deflowering’ their daughters. They claim he was caught red-handed on multiple occasions but has avoided justice through bribery. They beseech you, as their just ruler, to punish him accordingly. The merchant asks you for a private audience and says, ‘My lord, many merchants in your lands depend on my business contracts and I would be more than willing to make a hefty donation to your treasury if you were to see your way to ruling in my favor.’;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
