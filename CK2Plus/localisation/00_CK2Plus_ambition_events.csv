EVTDESC_Plus_900;I have served my liege loyally. Perhaps I should try to make friends with [Root.Liege.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_900;Let's try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_900;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_901;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], approached me after a council meeting today and asking me to join [From.GetHerHim] for supper. We both had a grand time, and I think perhaps I should continue to spend time with [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_901;Let's be friends, [From.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_901;[This.GetTitle]s have no friends. Only subjects and enemies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_902;I dined with my liege and now the two of us have agreed to go meet again within the fortnight. I think this is the beginning to a beautiful friendship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_903;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I had a great time at supper, but [From.GetSheHe] refused my kind offer to meet again. Perhaps another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_905;I feel the need to talk to someone. Perhaps one of my courtiers will entertain me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_905;Let's see what they have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_905;I'm not interested in these people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_906;[From.GetTitledFirstName] came by to talk with me today. We discussed many interesting subjects and [From.GetSheHe] seemed quite pleased. [From.GetSheHe] suggested that perhaps we should meet for a bottle of wine sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_906;That sounds great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_906;Perhaps another time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_907;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was interesting to talk to, and [From.GetSheHe] responded positively to the suggestion that we should drink together. I think I've made a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_908;[From.GetTitledFirstName] didn't seem too interested in being friends. Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_910;My liege seems bored these days. Perhaps I should invite [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] to practice fencing with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_911;I was sitting alone when [From.GetTitledFirstName] asked me if I wanted to spar with [From.GetHerHim]. I had a lot of fun... perhaps I should consider training with [From.GetHerHim] more often?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_912;[From.GetTitledFirstName] and I became friends, and I have taught [From.GetHerHim] how to fight better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_913;[From.GetTitledFirstName] didn't want to become a duelist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_915;I feel the need to talk to someone. Perhaps one of my liege's courtiers will entertain me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_916;[From.GetTitledFirstName] came by to talk with me today.  We discussed many interesting subjects and [From.GetFirstName] seemed to be quite pleased.  [From.GetSheHe] suggested perhaps we should meet for a bottle of wine sometime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_917;[From.GetTitledFirstName] was interesting to talk to, and [From.GetSheHe] responded positively to the suggestion that we should drink together. I think I've made a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_918;[From.GetTitledFirstName] didn't seem to interested in being friends. Oh well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_920;[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s current regent is not suitable. I should be regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_925;You have grown tired of being called '[Root.GetFirstNameWithNick]', and have insisted nobody call you that in your presence. Your councillors tell you it might be possible to get the commoners to stop using the nickname, but there's no guarantee they won't simply take up calling you by it again later. One's reputation cannot be controlled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_925;Just make them stop;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_925;Punish anyone who utters it—that will do the trick;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_925;Do whatever you have to, I don't care;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_925;Perhaps I should let it go...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_926;It took some time, but it seems the discouragement has paid off. Nobody calls you '[Root.GetFirstNameWithNick]' anymore... though how long that'll last is hard to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_927;There was a certain amount of 'persuasion' required, but eventually the commoners started calling you by your proper name again. Should they forget later, perhaps another reminder will be necessary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_928;For a time, it seemed like your efforts were successful... until you hear one of your courtiers slips up and calls you '[Root.GetFirstNameWithNick]' by accident. This will clearly take more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_928;Then we will take the time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
