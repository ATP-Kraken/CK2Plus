EVTNAME_PLUS_4605;The Imperial Feast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_PLUS_4605;Your feast caravan has finally returned completely bare and it seems to have been picked clean. A gleaming servant approaches you from the caravan saying that the emperor was very pleased with your feast, especially the '[Root.GetFeastMainDish]'. They were also rather pleased with the '[Root.GetFeastAppetizer]'. The emperor is requesting that you send more of it in the future.\nYou believe that this is most likely the start of a new trend in Eastern culinary experiences.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_PLUS_4605;Your feast caravan has finally returned with a few leftovers but it's not as full as it was when you sent it out. A confused seeming servant approaches you from the caravan saying that the emperor was very ambivalent about your feast, especially the '[Root.GetFeastMainDish]'. The servant goes on to say that he could not read the mood of the feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_PLUS_4605;Your feast caravan has finally returned. It returns with seemingly many leftovers. An apprehensive servant approaches you from the caravan saying that the emperor was very displeased about your feast, especially the '[Root.GetFeastMainDish]'. The servant goes on to say that barely any of the food they brought was eaten and were told by the emperor's men to take it back with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
