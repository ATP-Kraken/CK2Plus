EVTDESC_Plus_2300;Sahidic culture has been present ever since Saint Mark introduced Christianity to Egypt shortly after Christ's ascension. We speak our own language and maintain our own traditions, as we have for centuries. To some, we are the only true Egyptians that remained once the Muslims took over most of North Africa. As I am a Christian myself, perhaps it is time I embrace that distinction from the Arabs around me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2305;Sahidic culture existed in Egypt long before the Muslim conquest. We speak our own language and maintain our own traditions, as we have for centuries.
