EVTDESC20350;§Y[Root.job_spymaster.GetBestName]§! has successfully §Gincreased§! your Personal Spy Network by §Y10§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20352;My liege,\nTry as I might, my efforts to expand your spy network within [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] has encountered nothing but problems as of late. I hope you trust that this is merely bad luck, and that it will pass, for I intend to redouble my efforts immediately to overcome this setback.\n\nSincerely,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20356_nothing;Sadly, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s informants were good enough to tip [From.GetHerHim] off regarding your plans. Not only did the attempt do nothing, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is aware of your involvement and is reportedly furious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20356_small;Sadly, [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s informants were good enough to tip [From.GetHerHim] off regarding your plans. Still, that didn't happen quickly enough to prevent you from doing some damage -- though, admittedly, it was not very much. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is aware of your involvement and is reportedly furious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20356_med;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s informants made him aware of your attack, as well as your personal involvement, but not before [From.GetHerHis] network was dealt a serious blow. [From.GetSheHe] is reportedly furious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20356_large;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s informants made him aware of your attack, as well as your personal involvement, but not before [From.GetHerHis] network was dealt a significant blow. Indeed, you're quite sure the damage to [From.GetHerHis] network was greater than the effort it cost you. [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is reportedly furious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_20356;All that trouble for nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_20356;Well, at least I did some damage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20357_nothing;It's quite laughable. [FromFrom.GetTitledName] made an attempt to ferret out your various spies and informants, but [FromFrom.GetHerHis] attempt was so bungling all it did was reveal [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to you. Clearly [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is planning on making a move against you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20357_small;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] recently made a move to ferret out your various spies and informants. Your own network discovered [FromFrom.GetHerHis] plan quickly enough, but not before [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was able to do a bit of damage. Still, you know exactly who was behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20357_med;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] recently made a move to ferret out your various spies and informants. Your own network discovered [FromFrom.GetHerHis] plan quickly enough, but not before [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was able to do a fair amount of damage. Still, you know exactly who was behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20357_large;Bad news! Many of your informants and spies have gone missing as of late, enough to cause you a great deal of alarm. Someone is clearly targeting your spy network, and only belatedly did you discover who: [FromFrom.GetTitledName]. Clearly the [FromFrom.GetManWoman] has [FromFrom.GetHerHis] sights upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_20357;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] won't get away with this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20358_nothing;The attempt to dismantle [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s network of informants didn't go well, sadly. [FromFrom.GetHerHisCap] informants were good enough to tip [FromFrom.GetHerHim] off, but fortunately not good enough to reveal your part in the attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20358_small;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s network of informants took some damage at your hands, though the men and woman you captured were of relatively minor important. At least [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] wasn't able to discover your part in the attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20358_med;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s network of informants took a great deal of damage at your hands. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is still reeling, [FromFrom.GetHerHis] men on high alert now, and evidently has no idea of your involvement. A successful attack, to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20358_large;Your agents found some critical informants within [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s network and eliminated them before [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was able to react. [FromFrom.GetHerHisCap] men are on high alert, now, but they obviously had no inkling of your involvement. A job well done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_20358;At least [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is clueless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_20358;That will have to do, I suppose;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20359_nothing;Someone recently made an attempt to ferret out your network of informants. You discovered it before any damage was done, but you have no idea who was behind it all. For now, your men are on high alert.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20359_small;A number of your informants have recently gone missing, though no-one of critical importance. Thankfully, you got wind of the attack on your network before more damage could be done. Still, it would be nice to know who was behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20359_med;A number of your informants in [Root.Capital.GetName] have recently gone missing, simply vanished without a trace. It's clear that someone has been attacking your network, but, whoever they are, they're skilled enough to keep themselves hidden from your spies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC20359_large;Some of your critical informants in [Root.Capital.GetName] went missing recently. Their loss is a serious blow to your network of spies, and, far worse, you have no idea who was behind the attack. Your men are on high alert, but clearly someone is targeting you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
