EVTDESC_Plus_2604_jesus;In an elaborate ceremony conducted by [religion_head_title.Holder.GetTitledName], the late [new_saint.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has been formally recognized for [new_saint.GetHerHis] incredibly piety, so much so that [new_saint.GetSheHe] was spoken to by the Son of God Himself, and thus has been declared a [new_saint.Religion.GetName] saint. The faithful line the streets, listening to the hymns sung in the cathedral, and rejoice when the declaration is finally made: the [new_saint.GetManWoman] once known as [new_saint.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will now and forever more be known as Saint [new_saint.GetFirstNameWithNick].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2604_knight;In an elaborate ceremony conducted by [religion_head_title.Holder.GetTitledName], the late [new_saint.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has been formally recognized for [new_saint.GetHerHis] piety and the example [new_saint.GetSheHe] set as a true knight of Christendom, and thus has been declared a [new_saint.Religion.GetName] saint.

EVTDESC_Plus_2604_relhead;In an elaborate ceremony conducted by [religion_head_title.Holder.GetTitledName], the late [new_saint.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has been formally recognized for [new_saint.GetHerHis] leadership of the [new_saint.Religion.GetName] faithful as a true example of Christianity, and thus has been declared a [new_saint.Religion.GetName] saint.

EVTOPTA_Plus_2604;Glory to God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2610;The path to becoming a paragon of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is a difficult one, and will likely take years of dedication and patience before it is rewarded -- if, indeed, it is rewarded at all. There will be many setbacks along the way, and the purification of one's soul does not come without trial, but the truly faithful could perhaps see it through to the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2610;I shall persevere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2611;With your wealth, it would not be difficult to build a [Root.Religion.GetName] church in [Root.Location.GetName], and the clergy would be very grateful. It would go a long way to showing your dedication to piety.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2611;Yes, that's a wonderful idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2611;No, there are enough churches;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2612;The recent outbreak of a sickness in [Root.Location.GetName] brings to mind tales of saints who administered to the sick, doing whatever they can for the poor and helpless. Your advisors are alarmed, however, expressing their worry that exposing yourself to such illness is a very bad idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2612;Of course I will help the sick;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2612;They are right -- it's too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2613;Perhaps having heard of your efforts to treat the sick, a man riddled with disease has come to [Root.Location.GetName] asking that you lay on hands and pray to God that he be cured. One so faithful as yourself, he claims, is his best and only hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2613;I will touch him and pray;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2613;No, healing doesn't work that way;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2614;You've heard rumors of a wise ascetic monk living in a remote part of [Root.Location.GetName]. Perhaps if you undertake a journey to visit the man, he could impart his wisdom upon you. It would be a difficult voyage, however, far more so since you feel you must go it alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2614;I will go at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2614;No, it's not worth the risk;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2615;True dedication to the [Root.Religion.GetName] can not be done from a throne. If you are to be truly saintly, you must retreat to a monastery and take vows to serve God and only Him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2615;I will live my life in the service of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2615;No, I am meant for better things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2616;There are whispers in your court that one who has so much wealth cannot truly be considered humble or charitable, and that such dedication to the material world is hardly the sign of the saintly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2616;Wealth is unimportant to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2616;What should I do? Give it all away?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2617;During your recent bout of illness, one of your maids is shocked to discover your hands bleeding -- as if you were suffering from the same wounds Jesus Christ suffered upon the cross. There is no evidence of the stigmata later, but the maid's tale has spread throughout [Root.Location.GetName] and many seem to believe it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2617;Perhaps I am truly blessed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2618;You hear that [supporting_priest.GetBestName] has declared [supporting_priest.GetHerHis] support for your quest to attain saintly status. [supporting_priest.GetHerHisCap] last sermon was dedicated to lauding your virtues, and suggesting the [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful should emulate you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2619;You hear that [doubting_priest.GetBestName] has been openly doubting your quest for saintly status, suggesting it is proud that motivates you and not true dedication to God. The only thing that could possibly persuade [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] is to present yourself for testing -- but would it be performed fairly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2619;Allow [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] to test me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2619;Let [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] doubt -- I do not care;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2620;After a thorough questioning, [doubting_priest.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is clearly convinced of your piety and that your quest for sainthood is genuine. [doubting_priest.GetSheHeCap] begs your forgiveness, and suggests [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] will do whatever [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] can to help you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2621;After a thorough questioning, [doubting_priest.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] declares that you are no paragon of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and certainly no living saint. You are almost certain [doubting_priest.GetSheHe] had decided the outcome long before meeting you, and nothing you said could have persuaded [doubting_priest.GetHerHim] otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2621;Which of us truly lacks faith, I wonder?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2622;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your extreme piety and dedication to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Your name is constantly on the lips of the priests during their sermons, as they hold you up as an example to others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2623;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your dedication to knowledge and learning. You are a true [Root.Religion.GetName] scholar, they say, and the priests hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2624;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your charisma and dedication to diplomacy. God has bestowed upon you a light that others admire, they say, and the priests hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2625;As you continue your quest for sainthood, there are those who compliment your martial prowess against the infidels. You are a true [Root.Religion.GetName] warrior, they say, and the priests hold you up as an example to all others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2626;Your base lusts run contrary to everything a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should possess, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer them. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2626;I shall make the attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2626;No, this isn't worth it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2627;Your gluttunous nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2628;Your greedy nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2629;Your slothful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2630;Your envious nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2631;Your cruel nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2632;Your wrathful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2633;Pride is the deadliest sin, as it is the source of all others. If you truly aspire to be a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, you will need to conquer this belief that you deserve more than others. You must prostrate yourself before God and take what judgement He decrees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2634;Your deceitful nature runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2635;You will never truly be a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith until you conquer your ambition. It comes from a sense of pride, at seeking to raise yourself above others rather than to accept what God has given you. To forget one's ambitions, however, is not an easy task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2636;Your arbitrary sense of justice runs contrary to the ideal a proper [Root.GetManWoman] of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith should aspire to, and you will never achieve true sainthood until you conquer it. Attempting to do so, however, will be far from easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_lustful;For weeks you have tried to forget your lusts, to focus on chasteful thoughts and nothing else...but it has been no use. Not thinking such things leads to thinking of little else, until you are nearly mad from the attempt. You are cursed, and it seems nothing you do will change it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_gluttonous;For weeks you have nearly starved yourself, attempting to force yourself to be temperate as a good [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GetManWoman] ought to be...but it is no use. After a late-night binge in the kitchens, you have to admit that your will has been defeated by your appetite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_greedy;For weeks you have been trying to be charitable, giving coins away to those in need and considering what possessions you ought to offer as gifts. Each time, however, thoughts of what you have lost dominate your mind until it nearly drives you mad. The last time a beggar asked for alms you kicked him. Sadly, it is no use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_slothful;For weeks you have tried to be diligent, forcing yourself to attend to every important duty no matter how minor. It has done nothing but make you irritable, and you slowly find yourself making every excuse to do anything else. All you want to do now is sleep, and forget you ever wanted to be saintly. It's so much work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_envious;For weeks you have tried to be kind, forcing yourself to think well of others and not envy the things they have which you do not. It is all just a facade, however. The spite built up inside until you lashed out at everyone who crossed your path, and now you just feel awful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_cruel;For weeks you have tried to be gentle and kind to everyone who crossed your path. Your edicts have been merciful, your sentences have been brief...but it's no use. It's as if not thinking cruel thoughts has made them ALL you can focus on. You need some time in the dungeons before you truly go mad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_wroth;For weeks you have tried to control your temper. You have been patient with everyone, so patient that your courtiers frequently marvel at this change of heart. But you despise them for admiring what you know are false words. After beating a page near to death for spilling your wine, you have to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_proud;For weeks you have tried to show humility. You have complimented those who didn't truly deserve it, gave others an opportunity to act even when you knew better, tried not to be angry when things didn't go your way...but it's no use. You don't feel any different. Indeed, perhaps you're not sure *how* not to be proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_deceitful;For weeks you have tried to be scrupulously honest, even regarding things that one really shouldn't be honest about. You heart isn't truly in it, however, and sometimes you find yourself winding your way around the truth like a snake. It's time to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_ambitious;For weeks you have done nothing...almost literally. You've made no plans, made no attempts to work towards your goals, and indeed have tried to forget about your goals completely. Being content just feels so unnatural, however. You can't push the ambitions from your mind, and finally have to admit defeat. It isn't working.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2637_arbitrary;For weeks you have tried to be just in the way everyone expects. You've made every attempt to care about what's right and what's wrong, listened to your advisors, but it just seems so...pointless. You don't think you truly have a sense of justice, no matter how much you try. It's time to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2637;I will try again -- I must!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_lustful;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and your duties, attempting to put all lustful thoughts aside...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Perhaps whatever needs such thoughts served has been replaced by your love of God. Whatever the case, you now feel you can move forward, pure in deed as well as mind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_gluttonous;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and temperance, eating lightly and avoiding excess...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Your appetite has been replaced by a love of God and, while you may never be truly temperate, you can at least rest assured your gluttonous nature has been defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_greedy;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and charity...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Giving to others actually feels *good*. You never thought it would, really. No-one will ever accuse you of being truly charitable, but your overwhelming desire to accumulate things for yourself seems to have passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_slothful;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and your duties...and, to your surprise, it has worked. You have never felt so alive and full of energy. Granted, it's difficult and you are exhausted all the time, but you look back on the way you were and can only shake your head at all the years wasted doing nothing useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_envious;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and kind thoughts...and, to your surprise, it has worked. All the spite you used to feel just seems to take so much *energy*, you now can't imagine why you did it. Nobody will accuse you of being kind, perhaps, but a little of your love of God has now spread to others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_cruel;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and kind deeds...and, to your surprise, it has worked. Cruelty does not come quite so quickly as it used to, and it shocks you how good it feels to be generous from time to time. Perhaps such dark thoughts simply cannot survive in the light of God's love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_wroth;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and patience...and, to your surprise, it has worked. There have been no bouts of rage, no lashing out at anyone. When your old temper begins to rise, you think of God and it all seems to...melt away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_proud;Humility does not come easy. For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer, and to thinking of others before yourself. To your surprise, doing so feels good. The way they smile is a reward in and of itself, even if you get nothing else out of it. Perhaps this is what God's love truly means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_deceitful;For weeks you have been nothing but scrupulously honest, dedicating yourself to prayer and avoiding twisty thoughts of intrigue. To your surprise, it has worked. It has become easier and easier just to speak your heart, and you find yourself regretting the fact you ever felt the need to deceive others at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_ambitious;Putting aside your ambitions has not been easy. For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer and made no plans, and for a while it made you mad to feel so idle...and then, one morning, you just let it go. God shall provide, or shall not. Perhaps it truly is that simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2638_arbitrary;For weeks you have dedicated yourself to prayer, and to dealing with supplicants in the fairest manner possible. It all seemed like such pointless work, and so aggravating, until one day you realize right and wrong isn't so complicated. God's love is justice, and knowing that makes it so much easier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2638;God has given me a gift, and I shall not squander it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2639;There are those who question your mystic pursuits, wondering whether this is the act of a pious [Root.GetManWoman] of God or the dabblings of a pagan. You insist that it is the former, but perhaps not everyone will see it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2639;Am I not a good Christian?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2640;There are those who question your more...violent...interests, wondering whether these are the efforts of a zealous [Root.GetManWoman] of God or the darker urges of a criminal. You insist that it is the former, but perhaps not everyone will see it that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2640;I do what I do for God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2641;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your chaste nature becomes better-known to those around you. Priests in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] mention you in their sermons, saying that others should take their example from you and put aside their own lustful thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2641;All should strive for virtue;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2642;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your vow of celibacy becomes better-known to those around you. Priests in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] mention you in their sermons, saying that others should take their example from you and put aside their own lustful thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2643;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your charitable nature becomes better-known to those around you. Priests in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] mention you in their sermons, saying that others should take their example from you and put aside their own greed and envy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2644;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your kind nature becomes better-known to those around you. The people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] consider you a generous ruler, untouched by the harsh world, and an example to others who seem to know only hate and cruelty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2645;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your humility becomes better-known to those around you. Priests in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] mention you in their sermons, saying that others should take their example from you and put aside their own pride and concern for only themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2646;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your honest nature becomes better-known to those around you. Indeed, you recently told the truth to a visiting courtier when a lie would have served you far better...and the man was so impressed he told the tale far and wide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2647;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your sense of justice becomes better-known to those around you. The people of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] consider you a fair and wise ruler, trusting your edicts like they would almost no other, and an example to selfish rulers elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2648;As you continue your search for God and saintly status, your devotion to theology has gained you a great deal of admiration. '[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is a true Christian scholar,' they say, and many eagerly await copies of your studies on God and true faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2649;There are those who have questioned the voice you claim to hear, suggesting it is not Jesus but a demon, or worse. Now it seems that tide has turned, and more people in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are realizing that perhaps you do have a connection to the Divine, that you have been touched by God Himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2649;Jesus shall guide them, as he does me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ATTEMPT_FAILS;The attempt fails, perhaps with consequences...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ATTEMPT_SUCCEEDS;The attempt succeeds, perhaps with a price...\n;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
