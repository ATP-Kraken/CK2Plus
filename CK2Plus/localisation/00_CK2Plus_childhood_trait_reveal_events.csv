EVTDESC_Plus_4050;Recently you've been noticing changes, both physically and otherwise. Hair grows where there used to be none but more importantly you seem to have begun having... new feelings for those of the same sex as you. You feel as if they are more than just simply friends, but can't quite grasp this new feeling. Perhaps I should ask someone what's happening to me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PLUS_4050;I should ask my guardian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PLUS_4050;I'll think about it first;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
PLUS_4050_hover_ctt;§Y[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! becomes §Yopenly homosexual§!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PLUS_4051;Your ward approaches you with a barrage of questions. It seems they've finally noticed that their body is maturing and have a barrage of questions about it. They all seem to be quite normal questions until one strikes you as... a bit queer. It couldn't be that they are possibly attracted to those of the same sex?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PLUS_4051;I'll beat it out of them just to be safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_PLUS_4051;Lecture them on how inappropriate it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_PLUS_4051;I'm just reading too much into things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_PLUS_4052;I approached [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] with my questions. This however sent them into a wild rage and I became the recipient of one of the worst beatings of my life. In the end none of my questions are answered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_PLUS_4052;I am so confused...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PLUS_4053;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] seems to be mildly irritated at what I said about those of the same sex and lectured me that those are completely inappropriate feelings I should steel myself against.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_PLUS_4054;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] listens to your questions and whilst first seemingly perturbed decides to give you a long boring lecture on the natural order of things in regards to men and women. [From.GetSheHe] seems to have ignored the part that I asked about those of the same sex.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCa_Plus_4055;You notice that you seem to learn things much quicker than the other children. You started speaking much earlier, walking earlier and even ask questions the others children can't answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCb_Plus_4055;It seems no matter what you try these two rocks you are smacking together won't go away. Maybe a big person can help do it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCa_PLUS_4056;Your ward §Y[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! approaches you with a barrage of question. While not unusual for a child [From.GetHerHis] questions are surprisingly deep. You begin to realize that perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is smarter than the other children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCb_PLUS_4056;Your ward §Y[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]§! approaches you with a pair of rocks demanding you 'make them go away'. You begin to realize that [From.GetSheHe] is perhaps not the smartest child in the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
