EVTOPTA_Plus_500;England shall rule victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_501;The old Anglo-Saxon kingdom of England will now be forfeit…but do not despair! From its ashes a much more powerful and glorious realm will arise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_503;The Duchy of Normandy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_503;With the domination of this duchy the people are now more commonly referring to Neustria as Normandy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_504;The Islands and Peninsula south of Rome have fallen to those who oppose Christianity. Whispers have been heard that the pope the is frantically considering funding an expedition to reconquer the peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_504;The Fall of Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_504;What will the pope do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_504;And so they crumble;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_509;Unsurprisingly, the pope has chosen a promising local young Italian mercenary band to take control of Southern Italy away from the Heathens. With official Papal support, this young Mercenary captain hopes to achieve the crown of Sicily, as promised by the pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_509;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_509;The Champions Head Out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_510;The re-conquest of Sicily was an astounding success. The pope has motioned to officially crown the King of Sicily today. Already the pope makes plans for future such events, some have even said they’ve heard rumors of such a thing being called a Crusade. Time can only tell what will happen next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_510;King of Sicily;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_511;In a very surprising and bold move, the Pope has decided to give the Norsemen of the North a chance to prove themselves worthy of the crown of Sicily. Of course they submitted to papal authority prior to being allowed to invade Southern Italy. This should prove to be a very interesting series of events, no matter the outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_512;After having heard the success of the Normans, the pope has decided to give them an offer they can’t refuse. They’ll be allowed to invade southern Italy with full papal support. Should they succeed, they’ll be crowned by the pope himself as Kings of Sicily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_513;Having heard the news of southern Italy’s struggle, some Croatian mercenaries have volunteered to help the pope. Impressed by their determination and self-sacrifice, he has decided to give official papal support to these mercenaries to take back Italy. Should they succeed, the crown of Sicily awaits them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_514;Having heard the news of southern Italy’s struggle, some Serbian mercenaries have volunteered to help the pope. Impressed by their determination and self-sacrifice, he has decided to give official papal support to these mercenaries to take back Italy. Should they succeed, the crown of Sicily awaits them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_515;Often forgotten, there are still resident Greeks in southern Italy. After having affirmed their support of the Pope of Rome they now seek to re-conquer their lost lands from the heathen invaders. Motivation is certainly not lacking for these people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_516;An auspicious day it is indeed, for you will be crowned the King of Sicily by none other than the pope himself. As you approach the pope, you can't help but feel a sense of pride rise within you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_516;The Coronation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_516;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_517;The pope's plans have failed. His trusted champions have been dispersed, and there's little hope for a Christian reconquering of Sicily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_517;The Sicilian Invasion Fails;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_517;Disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_517;Too bad for the Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_520;A New Culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_520;A New Culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_521;A New Culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_521;The people of [From.GetName] have taken to calling themselves Albanians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_521;I don't care, as long as they pay their taxes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_521;I admire their culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_522;The Kingdom of Albania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_522;The Kingdom of Albania, once de-jure part of Greece, has formed it's own kingdom under [Root.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_522;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_523;The Kingdom of Albania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_523;The Kingdom of Albania, once de-jure part of Greece, has formed it's own kingdom under [From.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_523;Interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_524;Your Grace, the vile Polish have taken the Moravian territories from us and in their naivety they think they could claim the Duchy of Bohemia as well! Of course we could defeat them single-handedly, the problem is that they are a little bit more powerful at the moment and so we should probably resort to some more cunning tactics...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_524;A temporary setback;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_524;They will never take our freedom!! Hopefully;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_535;The Bulgarian state has finally perished by your hands and their 'empire' has collapsed into ruins. The conflict that has lasted decades is over and we can rejoice that our northern borders are safe once more and our control of the Balkans is undisputed. For this achievement you are going to be known for at least another millennium.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_535;Call me the Bulgar-Slayer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_536;My lord, nothing less than a miracle has occurred. We have repelled the full scale Byzantine invasion and our Empire is safe once more. But discontent is growing in the Roman lands and the position of the Basileus is balancing on the edge. Maybe we could benefit from that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_536;Take them down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_536;Macedonia will be more than enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_536;We should be grateful for what we have;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_537;A Christian monk by the name of Sigfrid has arrived from the Catholic churches of Västergotland. He would like to preach at Your court and show You the benefits of Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_537;What can I do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_538;Sigfrid has continued preaching his religion in our capital, and he seems to be gathering a larger and larger audience. After listening to one of his sermons, you have to admit that the new faith may have some advantages...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_538;It is for the good of the realm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_538;We shall bow to none!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_539;Swedish King Converts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_539;The Pagan King of Sweden has decided to be baptized by Siegfried of Glastonbury and converted to Christianity. It looks like that the era of the Old Gods is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_539;What's that noise? Oh, that is Valhalla crumbling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_541;Fall of the Córdoban Caliphate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_541;A messenger has arrived from Iberia - the last remnants of the Caliphate of Córdoba has been destroyed. It was the last bastion of the Umayyad Empire, the greatest Muslim realm the world has ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_541;So it goes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_542;Fall of the Caliphate of Cairo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_542;A messenger has arrived from Egypt - the last remnants of the Caliphate of Cairo, an Empire created by the Fatimids has fallen to obscurity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_543;The forces you ordered to assemble are now ready to invade the Kingdom of England. We shall teach the Anglo-Saxons a lesson they will not forget!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_543;To the longships!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_543;I've changed my mind;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_544;My King! The dreadful Norse ruler of Denmark, vile Sweyn Forkbeard has finished consolidating his gains in Norway and now he has stated that he is going to invade England as many Vikings have done before…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_545;After years of careful planning, Olaf Haraldsson, the last male descendant of Harald Fairhair has raised a large army of exiles, mercenaries and hopefuls, declaring intention to retake the Crown of Norway by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_547;A papal bull has arrived demanding the return of Holy Rome to the Papacy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_547;Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_547;Refuse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_549;Attacking [From.GetTitledName] may be a mistake -- as the head of the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, [From.GetSheHe] has the right to excommunicate us...a right [From.GetSheHe] has now chosen to exercise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_549;That won't stop me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_550;[rightful_relhead.GetTitledName] has sent a formal request that we aid [rightful_relhead.GetHerHim] in [rightful_relhead.GetHerHis] war against [relhead_enemy.GetTitledName]. As a righteous [Root.Religion.GetName], it is my duty to protect the [rightful_relhead.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]...or is it? What could [rightful_relhead.GetSheHe] truly do if I refuse?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_550;We will defend the [rightful_relhead.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_550;We will send volunteers and donations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_550;I see no reason to get involved;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_550;We will donate to the [rightful_relhead.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]'s cause;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_553;The Bræðralag Founded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_553;We have founded the Bræðralag, a fellowship of sworn brethren fighting for a place in Valhalla!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_554;The Bræðralag;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_554;The Bræðralag are proud heathen warriors who swear oaths of brotherhood to each other, and swear to fight until they please Oðinn and the heathen gods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_554;Their place in Valhalla is assured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_554;More barbaric miscreants to be slaughtered...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_555;The Jomsvikings Founded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_555;We have founded the Jomsvikings, a brotherhood of berserker warriors who wear wolf-skins and unleash their fury on the enemies of the Norse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_556;The Jomsvikings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_556;A band of fierce Vikings have established a warrior brotherhood. These Jomsvikings are devoted to Thor, Odin and the other Norse gods. They brook no quarter on the battlefield and will permit only the strongest and ablest warriors amongst their number.\n\nThough there are those who would dismiss them as simple brigands, the Jomsvikings have vowed to defend all Norse lands being encroached by Christendom or other foreign religions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_557;Now that control of the kingdom has left Basque hands, a new name should be decided for this kingdom. Yourself and your council have decided on the name Navarra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_557;The Kingdom of Nevarra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_558;Now that the war is over, and [Root.GetTitledFirstName] has handed out titles to deserving generals, the Magyar soldiers have largely disbanded and have begun to settle into their new homes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_558;This is our home, now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_560;The Harii;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_560;We have refounded the Harii, a fierce order of Germanic warriors who held back the Romans in ancient days. They will be used against enemies of the faith again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_561;The Harii Founded;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_561;The Harii have been refounded. These Germanic warriors once held back the Roman Empire and are loyal to their pagan faith. They will fight their enemies to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_561;They honor their ancestors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_562;[From.GetTitledName] has issued a call that [Root.GetTitledName] has become decadent and corrupt, and that neither he nor his descendants deserve to hold the [From.Religion.GetName] Caliphate. Whether [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will make a move against the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_562;How dare he!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_562;This is how it must be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_562;[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is absolutely right;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_562;No, I support [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_562;This is none of my concern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_563;The High King of Ireland is traditionally held by an Irish king who can prove dominance over the others. [From.GetTitledName] has declared that [From.GetSheHe] is more deserving of the title than [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], and intends to press [From.GetHerHis] claim to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_563;I dare [From.GetHerHim] to try!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_564;The Rise of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_564;[Root.GetBestName] has proven himself a capable warrior, to the point that he has inspired his [Root.Culture.GetName] followers to assemble their clans and follow him as their nomadic leader. Nearby rulers are already fearing what this could mean to the balance of power in their region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_564;Let all tremble before us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_566;Eastern Roman Empire?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_566;[Root.GetHerHisCap] majesty, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] stands today in front of the nobility, clergy, foreign dignitaries, and -most importantly- [Root.GetHighGodName]. An announcement whose words carry the heaviest of weights is made as a new chapter in history is written: The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], and most importantly, [Root.GetTitle] [Root.GetDynName] claims succession to the Roman administration in the East. As [Root.GetSheHe] is confirmed by the [Root.GetPriestTitle]s, [Root.GetBestName] is coronated as rightful Emperor in the East.\nA new era has begun, and history will eventually prove whether or not this display of grandiosity was just, or if it will lead to a downfall of vanity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_566;Praise [Root.GetHighGodName]! Long live the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
