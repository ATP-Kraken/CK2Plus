EVTNAME_Plus_2351;The Journey of Nerthus;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2351;With [nerthus_top_liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] in a time of peace, [Root.GetTitledName] has declared that the time has come for the Journey of Nerthus. The fertility goddess will travel across the land in a covered chariot, with only [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] permitted to look upon her, her arrival in each hold calling for a time of feasting and celebration. It is one of the most holy of Germanic traditions, a period during which lords are not permitted to engage in war, at least until the goddess tires of her travels and retires to the sacred grove again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2351;We will celebrate with a great feast!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2351;Excellent, I was already planning a feast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2351;The celebrations will be kept to a minimum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2351;Alas, I cannot afford a great feast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_2351;This will be a joyous time for all;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_Plus_2351;Must we pay homage to a pagan sex goddess?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2352;With the feasts throughout [nerthus_top_liege.PrimaryTitle.GetName] now done, and the holy cart having completed its circuit throughout the land, the goddess Nerthus has apparently tired of her communications with mortal men and returned to the sacred grove in Castum. [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has declared the holy time at an end, with the fields now blessed and many married women now hoping to conceive in this most auspicious period following the journey's close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2352;Another journey has ended;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2352;It's over? What a relief;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2353;With the journey ended, you alone see to the purification of the holy cart used to convey the 'goddess'. It is carefully washed by slaves, who are then thrown into the lake and drowned--grateful for the honor they have been granted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2353;Until the next journey begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2354;The Journey of Nerthus has begun, and you hear many tales of fertility rites her priests can perform. Considering you are childless, perhaps it is worth seeking out the goddess's blessing upon your womb, dangerous as you hear those rites can be...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2354;Perhaps Nerthus can help with my...problem;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2354;There is nothing wrong with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2356;Irminsul Reborn;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2356;At no small expense, a new world tree has been planted in the sacred woods outside of Paderborn -- not far from the location where the previous Irminsul was destroyed. There have been months of careful rites performed, the ground consecrated with the blood of many slaves, and it has been determined that this time it will not be so easy for the tree to be violated as it was previously. A great wrong to the Germanic faith has now been undone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2356;Let the world tree grow large and strong;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
