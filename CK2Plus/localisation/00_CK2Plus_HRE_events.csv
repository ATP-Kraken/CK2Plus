EVTNAME_Plus_1152;A New Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1152;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has assumed the throne of the Carolingian Empire... and now it falls to you to decide whether you will accept [From.GetHerHis] rule, or whether you will break the oaths of fealty and declare independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1152;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] will find its own path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1152;[From.GetSheHeCap] is my emperor, and all of ours;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1153;My [Root.GetLordLady] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt is my position that the Carolingian Empire is a legacy deserving of the likes of Charlemagne, and requires a ruler of sufficient substance and character to earn its support. I believe that ruler is not you, and thus the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] hereby declares its independence from the empire. We will find our own way from this day on.\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1153;An outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1157;The Holy Roman Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1157;To the most devout and serene [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nIn the name of the Lord, I, [From.GetTitledName], agree to offer my blessing and will anoint you as Holy Roman Emperor. May your rule be both just and eternal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1158;'In the name of Christ, I, [From.GetTitledFirstName], promise, pledge and guarantee in the sight of God and the blessed Apostle Peter that I will be the protector and defender of this holy Roman Church in all ways useful to her, however many, in so far as I am supported by divine assistance according to my knowledge and ability.'\n\nToday [From.GetTitledFirstName] was crowned by his Holiness the Pope and formally received the title of Holy Roman Emperor and the Imperial Regalia with the blessing of the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1159;Offer to become [From.GetHerHis] devout vassal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1159;Wish [From.GetHerHim] well;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1160;To [Root.GetHerHisCap] Imperial Majesty, [Root.GetTitledName],\nI offer my congratulations on your coronation, and, as a loyal subject to [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName], I hereby offer you my devout oath of fealty. Let the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] become part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nSigned in faith,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1160;Accept [From.GetHerHis] oath of fealty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1160;No, I don't want [From.GetHerHim] as a vassal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1161;The Carolingian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1161;The throne of the Carolingian Empire is not an easy thing to hold. Its vassals are notoriously independent, and as each generation of rulers gets further from Charlemagne, their memory of what the throne stands for grows more distant. For now, at least, your rule appears to be safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1162;End of the Carolingian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1162;Though you recently assumed the Carolingian throne, it appears it is not yours to hold. The Pope has refused to anoint you with his blessing, and indeed there are far too many who consider the throne to exist only in name. To them, you claim of the imperial title is meaningless. The once-great empire of Charlemagne has fallen to chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1162;No! This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1163;End of the Carolingian Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1163;While [From.GetTitledFirstName] has assumed the throne of the Carolingian Empire, it appears that far too many consider [From.GetHerHis] title to exist purely in name. The Pope has refused to anoint [From.GetHerHim] with his blessing, and thus the once-great empire of Charlemagne has fallen to chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1163;This is terrible news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1163;So be it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1164;Part of the agreement made between [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [current_pope.GetTitledFirstName] for [From.GetHerHis] coronation was the turning over of certain lands in central Italy to the Pope's control -- lands which include part of your domain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1164;What? I never agreed to this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1170;Since you are not a subject of the Holy Roman Empire, some of your titles have become de facto kingdoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1171;Under the laws of the Holy Roman Empire, some of your titles have been demoted to a slightly lesser rank.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1175;I expressed my wishes and desires for a coronation in Rome to his holiness the Pope. Hopefully he will accept my request so that I can begin inviting my lords to attend the coronation ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1175;Of course he will accept;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1176;To the most Reverend and Blessed Apostolic Pope,\n\nI would like to ask you for your blessing in my rule as Emperor-elect by holding officially holding a coronation ceremony in my honor.\n\nYour most devoted subject,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1176;[From.GetFirstName] is deserving of a crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1176;[From.GetFirstName] is no true Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1177;To the most devout and serene [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nIn the name of the Lord, I, [From.GetTitledName], would like to offer you my blessing to allow your coronation in Rome, as [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Emperor, under my guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1177;Excellent, send out the a message to invite all my lords;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1178;To [Root.GetHerHisCap] Majesty [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nIn the name of the Lord, I, [From.GetTitledName], would like to inform you that I deem you are not yet worthy and just enough as a ruler to be offered my blessings to become crowned as the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Emperor. The Lord surely has much faith in you as you have in him, but remember that the honor of receiving His blessing does not come easy and is only for the purest of souls.\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1178;Why can't he ever just say:No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1179;To Noble [Root.GetTitledFirstName],\nYou should be happy to know that, I, [From.GetTitledName], will hold a coronation ceremony in Rome in my honor with the blessing of his Holiness the Pope. You received the honor to be invited to attend the ceremony, which will be held soon in Rome. I await your positive reply.\n\nYour most Holy Lord and Liege,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1179;I will attend the ceremony;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1179;I refuse to set foot in that pompous windbag's castle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1180;[From.GetTitledName] is sorry to inform you that [From.GetSheHe] will not be able to attend the coronation ceremony in Rome as [From.GetSheHe] has more important issues to attend to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1180;I have no words for such dishonor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1181;Today I was crowned by his Holiness the Pope and formally received the title of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Emperor and the Imperial Regalia with the blessing of the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1181;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1181;This will strengthen my rule significantly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1182;Today [From.GetTitledFirstName] was crowned by his Holiness the Pope and formally received the title of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetAdjective] Emperor and the Imperial Regalia with the blessing of the Pope. The ceremony was magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1182;Long may [From.GetTitledFirstName] live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1183;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been crowned and received the Imperial Regalia by his holiness the Pope in the St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The divine blessings conveyed by his Holiness the Pope confirm the right of rule over all Imperial lands governed by [From.GetTitledFirstName] and his appointed vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1183;Ok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1184;'In the name of Christ, I, [Root.GetTitledFirstName], promise, pledge and guarantee in the sight of God and the blessed Apostle Peter that I will be the protector and defender of this holy Roman Church in all ways useful to her, however many, in so far as I am supported by divine assistance according to my knowledge and ability.'\n\nToday [Root.GetTitledFirstName] was crowned by his Holiness the Pope and formally received the title of Holy Roman Emperor and the Imperial Regalia with the blessing of the Pope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1184;Pope Crowns Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1185;The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] United;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1185;The Kingdom of Aquitaine has been united fully under the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] as a single kingdom, with a single crown, and a single ruler in [Root.GetTitledFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1186;With Lotharingia and Burgundy having fallen under my domain, my relatives are crying foul. They are demanding to meet with me at Meerssen, to create a new treaty to replace the Treaty of Verdun which first split up the Frankish Empire. If I do not, there will be no peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1186;Agree to the new treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1186;No, the inheritance is rightfully mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1187;The Treaty of Meerssen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1187;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has met with his vassals at Meerssen and come up with a new treaty following his inheritance of Lotharingia and Burgundy. This will more equitably split the lands of Lothaire among his heirs, and allow for peace—at least for a time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1188;[From.GetTitledFirstName] has inherited both Lotharingia and Burgundy, lands that were intended to be spread amongst the heirs of Lothaire. [From.GetSheHeCap] has refused to even discuss the issue of inheritance, all but daring his vassals to press the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1188;It is not worth fighting over;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1188;This cannot be allowed to stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
