EVTNAME_FemRule_100;My Daughter is my Heir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_100;Since I still don't have a male heir, I may need to consider the possibility of my realm passing to my daughter. Rulership is harder for a woman, but not impossible. If I were to start raising her as my heir now, she would be better prepared should she succeed me to the throne...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_100;I will raise a ruler to be proud of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_100;I might still have a son.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_100;This will never happen. Stop asking me about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_101;I am told my [From.GetFatherMother] does not wish me to be [From.GetHerHis] heir, and will put me aside as soon as [From.GetSheHe] has a son. It doesn't seem fair!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_101;I must earn my right to rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_101;But I deserve to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_101;I must bow to [From.GetHerHis] wishes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_105;My daughter is no longer under my tutelage to become the next ruler. What now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_105;I have a son now. That's all that matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_105;I have another daughter who can take her place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_105;There is nothing to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_111;As the last hope for the continuation of his bloodline, it appears I am to be acknowledged by my father at long last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_111;It's about time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_113;My council advises me that my best hope for an heir is to acknowledge one of my bastards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_113;Very well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_113;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_120;While some might consider it inappropriate for a [Root.Religion.GetName] woman to bear arms, my knowledge of martial affairs and training with the blade have made me the equal of any man. I must now consider whether this is a path I intend to pursue in the years to come, or whether I will put aside such things for good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_120;This is my path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_120;I will be a proper [Root.Religion.GetName] woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_125;I have been taught to fight with the blade and to lead men into battle. This is an honorable pursuit for a [Root.Religion.GetName] woman, and I can devote myself to such a path knowing [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] smiles upon me. Some say, however, that the role of a wife and mother should be my focus instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_125;I shall be a wife and mother, no more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_135;It has come to your attention that [From.Liege.GetTitledName] is training [From.GetTitledFirstName] in the art of combat. This is highly inappropriate for a young woman of [From.Religion.GetName] faith—perhaps she needs a new tutor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_135;Offer the [From.Liege.GetTitle] my services;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_136;[From.GetTitledName] has offered [From.GetHerHis] services in tutoring [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], suggesting it is inappropriate for a [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] girl to spend her time training with swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_136;Perhaps this is for the best;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_136;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] will be raised how I see fit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_138;My dear [This.GetTitle], your offer is deeply appreciated. I am afraid [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] will continue to be tutored by her current guardian until I see fit to do otherwise.\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_138;A foolish decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_140;Age and poor health are wearing on me. If I am honest, it is time I realize I cannot serve as my liege's champion any longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_140;I must inform [Root.Liege.GetHerHim] of the bad news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_141;I have received a letter from [From.GetBestName], informing me that he is no longer able to serve as my champion. Age and ill health, it seems, have gotten the best of him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_141;Sad news indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_145;I believe I would be a better champion for my lady liege than the man she currently favors with the title. Perhaps I should ask it of her?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_145;The honor should be mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_145;I'm not interested in being champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_146;A letter has arrived from [From.GetBestName], saying that he is ready and eager—and more than qualified—to be my new champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_146;I accept [From.GetHerHis] gracious offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_146;I would rather keep my current champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_146;No, and do not ask me again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FemRule_146;I want no further petitions of this kind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_147;My liege and lady, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is evidently not entirely happy with my performance as her champion. I hear that she has considered a petition from another who claims to be a better warrior than I, and thus better able to defend her honor. So far, however, I have heard nothing on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_147;I must try harder to be worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_147;If she chooses to replace me, then so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_150;The day of the hunt has come! This is a wonderful chance for the court to venture to the countryside, indulge in fine weather, and allow the men to engage in their bloody sport.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_150;What fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_151;We've had such a delightful time together, chasing after the men on their horses, marveling as they try their best to impress both of us. I think I may have found a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_151;I value this new friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_151;It won't outlast the hunt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_152;She has been such an irritant on this hunting trip, with not a single good word to say and always taking up the attention of the hunters. Does she not know who I am?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_152;How dare she ruin my hunt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_152;I will grit my teeth and hold my tongue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_200;A great tournament, the like of which is not seen every year, has been announced in our realm! You are invited to watch it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_200;Of course, I MUST be there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_200;My faithful champion will represent me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_200;Watch? I will show them my mettle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FemRule_200;No, I will not attend;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_201;As [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s champion, you are expected to defend her colours in the great tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_201;I will bring my lady the prize!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_202;Your champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], died of wounds sustained during the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_203;Your champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has been crippled in the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_204;Your champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has been injured in the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_205;Your very own champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has won the grand tournament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_205;Celebrate with a large feast;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_205;A discrete celebration will suffice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_206;Your very own champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has taken second place at the tournament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_207;Your very own champion, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has taken third place at the tournament!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_210;All the men are looking at me and all the other ladies are jealous of me! I feel justified in my pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_210;Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_211;I'm receiving a lot of attention, but I won't let it get to me. We all have our virtues and our vices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_211;I am humble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_212;This tournament is wonderful, there are so many people to talk to! I've met so many new friends already...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_213;There are so many strange people here, I don't feel at ease around them. Just now, a woman I have never seen before tried to strike up a conversation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_213;But, my lady, we haven't even been introduced!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_214;Not everyone here seems to appreciate my honesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_214;But I'm only telling the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_215;The ladies here are so easy to fool. I could tell them that in Cathay the sky is green, and they would believe me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_215;The poor gullible fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_216;Some of the knights here are really dreamy. If one of them were to proposition me, I think I would swoon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_216;Youth must have some dalliance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_217;Some of the ladies here let their heads be turned by a pretty face and a dashing joust, but not I.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_217;My honour is safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_218;I may have been admitted into the tournament, but I keep hearing jeering whispers behind me. It seems some of the men here think I'm unworthy of competing in their martial games.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_218;I can't wait to get my revenge in the melée;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_218;Let them talk...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_220;The lords and ladies assembled here have long argued over who is the fairest, but the tournament's champion has crowned me with a wreath of flowers, as the most noble, graceful, and beautiful lady present!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_221;The lords and ladies assembled argued over who is the fairest, but in the end it was Lady [From.GetFirstName] who was crowned with a wreath of flowers as the queen of the tournament, declaring her the most noble, graceful, and beautiful lady present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_221;How dare they! I deserved the crown!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_221;Of course SHE wins it. They would never pick me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_221;She deserves it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_222;There was much discussion at the tournament about which lady had the most grace, nobility, and beauty, but finally it was decided [From.GetTitledFirstName] was the fairest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_226;You've seen Sir [From.GetFirstName] joust and train for the tournament, and must admit he is quite an attractive fellow. Perhaps...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_226;Give him a signal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_226;Nothing good could come of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_227;I always seem to bump into [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [From.GetSheHe] holds my eye for just a little too long before looking away. As if [From.GetSheHe]'s expecting something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_227;I should speak to [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_229;Sir [From.GetFirstName] approached me when we are a little apart from the crowd. I think I've made a catch! I'll ask him to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_229;...joust with a token of my favour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_229;...accompany me to see the musicians and singers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_229;...show me how to hit a bullseye on the archery range.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FemRule_229;...get out of my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_230;I keep trying to attract [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s attention, and he keeps ignoring me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_230;Sigh. So much for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_231;Lady [From.GetFirstName] tied her scarf around my arm and I took to the lists to joust...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_231;...unhorsing my opponent in the first pass!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_231;...but was knocked off my horse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_232;Lady [From.GetFirstName] wanted to see the musicians and singers who came from afar to our tournament. I walked her to see them, and then I undertook to impress her by...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_232;...composing a love ballad which met with general approval.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_232;...dancing, but I stepped on her foot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_233;Lady [From.GetFirstName] wanted me to teach her archery, so we headed to the tournament range and I...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_233;...showed her so well, she hit the bulls-eye;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_233;...couldn't hit the target myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_234;I thought Lady [From.GetFirstName] fancied me and approached her alone, but she shooed me off laughing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_234;Obviously a case of female hysteria. Obviously.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_235;[From.GetTitledFirstName] is truly fascinating, and has been nothing short of attentive and charming throughout the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_235;We should see each other again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_235;I'll leave my bedroom door ajar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_236;Sir [From.GetFirstName] seemed charming, but he embarrassed himself when we were in public.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_236;I'm never speaking to him again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_236;Maybe I should try and know him better before judging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_236;I'll still leave my bedroom door ajar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_237;Lady [From.GetFirstName] and I seemed to be getting on so well, when she told me she never wanted to see me again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_237;I've been dumped? ME?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_238;[From.GetTitledFirstName] discretely led me to believe [From.GetSheHe]'d be waiting alone in [From.GetHerHis] bedroom tonight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_238;...and I'll go to [From.GetHerHim], of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_238;...that's not going to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_238;...I'll show her how courtly love is better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_239;Lady [From.GetFirstName] suggested we continue our courtly romance after the tournament.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_239;I'm already writing her a poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_239;I don't think that's a good idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_239;I'd rather stay friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_240;Sir [From.GetFirstName] has rejected any suggestion of a romance between us, the cad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_240;I hate him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_241;As I'd expected, Sir [From.GetFirstName] discretely came to my room tonight while I was there alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_241;*pant* *pant*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_242;Sir [From.GetFirstName] has sworn he'll stay true to me, though leagues may separate us, people surround us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_242;This is love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_243;Sir [From.GetFirstName] is sorry, but he only wanted to be friends, he wasn't looking for love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_243;Friendship is good too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_243;You...you can't friend zone a woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_245;All good things have an end, and the grand tournament is over. You got to see the jousts, the melee, the archery contest and mingle with all the lords and their ladies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_245;A jolly fun time was had by all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_246;Unfortunately, the tournament has been canceled;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_246;But I was having fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_300;Since you have no living sons by [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], her former titles have been returned to her upon your death and will instead pass to her heirs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_300;I suppose it is only right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_301;Since you have no living sons by [From.GetTitledFirstName], on his death your former titles have been returned to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_301;I should hope so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_302;Since [From.GetTitledFirstName] has no living sons by [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], on his death the titles that he had gained through the right of Jure Uxoris have now been returned to her and shall pass to her heirs instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_302;Perhaps she will marry more carefully this time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_303;Since you have no living sons by [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], by right the titles that he once stripped from you have been returned and will fall instead to your heir rather than his.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_303;Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_304;Since you have no living sons by [From.GetTitledFirstName], the titles you once stripped from her by right of Jure Uxoris will instead fall to her heir rather than yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_305;Since [From.GetTitledFirstName] has no living sons by [Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], the titles he stripped from her by right of Jure Uxoris fall to her heir rather than his.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_305;It seems only fair, doesn't it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_310;The titles you stripped from [From.GetTitledFirstName] through the right of Jure Uxoris were yours only as part of her dowry. As a result of your divorce, those titles are thus legally returned to her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_310;Damnable woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_311;As a result of the divorce between [From.GetTitledFirstName] and [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], she now legally regains the titles stripped from her by right of Jure Uxoris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_312;My dear husband,\nPerhaps you thought I would not notice if you handed my titles off to someone else? Considering your claim to them is by right of our marriage, with the express intention that it would pass to a child of our union, anything else means they return to me. They are part of my dowry after all, yes?\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_360;My overbearing husband, [From.GetFirstName], has been constantly interfering in the rulership of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and has of late grown beyond the merely opinionated. The garrison in [Root.Capital.GetName] has already begun to defer to his word before mine. Sadly, [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]'s laws support him, and he could usurp my rule if I am not careful. What shall I do? Who can I turn to?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_360;I will turn to my lover;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_360;I will turn to my family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_360;One of my faithful councillors can help me;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FemRule_360;Perhaps my good friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_FemRule_360;[From.GetFirstName] has enemies, does he not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_FemRule_360;There is nothing I can do, and no-one to turn to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_361;My beloved [From.GetFirstName] informs me that her domineering husband, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], is attempting to usurp her rights in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. She does not know what to do, and has turned to me for help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_361;I will go to her at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_361;I shall deal with the cur myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_361;Alas, I cannot help her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_362;Oh no! My hot-headed lover has decided to take matters into his own hands! He intends to ambush [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] and kill him, no matter who sees it or the damage to our reputation! Alas, it is too late to send him a message...all I can do is wait and hope for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_362;What if something happens to him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_363;You are out hunting with a few trusted companions, when - suddenly - the forest is filled with the lethal twanging of crossbows firing from hidden locations. You try to spur your horse to safety, but too late, a bolt slams into your ribcage and knocks you from the saddle. The last thing you see is [From.GetTitledFirstName] gazing down upon with grim satisfaction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_364;You are out hunting with a few trusted companions, when - suddenly - the forest is filled with the lethal twanging of crossbows firing from hidden locations. Thankfully you avoid harm, and when [From.GetTitledFirstName] rushes out at you with sword drawn, you match his blows. After a brief fight, you wound him and he is forced to flee. A close call indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_364;[FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s doing, no doubt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_365;You ambushed [From.GetTitledFirstName] while he was out riding with only a few trusted companions - all scythed down like wheat by hidden crossbowmen. You could not help but feel a grim satisfaction as you stood over the dying [From.GetFirstName] and watched him breathe his last, knowing he would never threaten your beloved [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName] again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_365;Serves him right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_366;It's over. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] ambushed and killed [From.GetTitledFirstName], just as he said he would. While the threat of usurpation is over, everyone knows what [FromFrom.GetFirstName] did...and they all believe that you were behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_366;Oh, you foolish, foolish man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_367;Everything did not go according to plan. [From.GetTitledFirstName] not only survived the ambush, he also bested you in a swordfight, injuring you in the process. You fled, cursing his name, and he set his men after you. Whatever happens, you will not tell him of [FromFromFrom.GetFirstName]'s involvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_368;[FromFrom.GetFirstName] ambushed [From.GetTitledFirstName], just as he said he would, but it was no use. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was wounded and fled, and now [From.GetTitledFirstName] has the sympathy of your vassals as well as a strong suspicion regarding who was behind it all. You are left with no recourse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_369;Your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has approached you with an urgent problem: her boorish husband, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has begun to enforce his will in her domain. Indeed, the right of Jure Uxoris means he may very well usurp her titles out from under her unless something is quickly done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_369;I shall go to her at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_369;She is on her own in this matter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_370;My dear [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has sent me an urgent letter. It speaks of her boorish husband, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], and how he is enforcing his will in her domain. Indeed, unless something is quickly done, he may very well usurp her titles through the right of Jure Uxoris.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_370;I will go to [From.Capital.GetName] with a large retinue to protect her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_370;I will go to her personally;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_370;She is on her own in this matter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_371;I received a letter from my friend, [From.GetTitledFirstName], with unfortunate news: her husband is preparing to usurp her domain, and the laws of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] appear to support him. She begs me for help, or all is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_372;Here's an interesting thing: [From.GetTitledName] has contacted me, saying that her husband is preparing to usurp her domain through the right of Jure Uxoris. Knowing of my long-standing rivalry with [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], she begs for my intervention to stop him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_373;You receive the worst news. Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], writes to tell you that there is nothing [From.GetSheHe] can do to stop your husband. You are on your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_373;I really thought [From.GetSheHe] might help...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_374;Good news! Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], not only came to [Root.Capital.GetName], [From.GetSheHe] brought a number of soldiers and advisors to help you. [From.GetSheHe] says [From.GetSheHe] cannot stay long, but these men should help keep [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] in line.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_374;Oh, happy day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_375;I only stayed in [From.Capital.GetName] for a little while. However, I left a behind a few advisors and hardened retainers to keep an eye on [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] in my absence. My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], said she feels much more secure and thanked me profusely. Hopefully this will be enough to prevent further trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_375;We shall see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_376;An obstacle to my plans has arisen: [FromFrom.GetTitledName] recently visited [From.GetFirstName], leaving behind a group of faithful retainers and advisors—all more capable than [From.GetFirstName], and clearly instructed to stymy my efforts. Unless I deal with them, I will not be able to take [From.GetFirstName]'s titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_376;There is nothing I can do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_376;I will kill them all, if I must;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_376;Clever subversion is called for;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_FemRule_376;I will win them over with my charm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_377;It has been a week since [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s retainers came to [Root.Capital.GetName], and since then I have seen little of [From.GetFirstName]. He sulks, frustrated, but there is little he can do. It seems my rule is safe, at least for the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_377;This is a great relief;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_378;You endured the swaggering and arrogance of your wife's new allies for a few days. Then, one day while they were out hunting, you tracked them down with a dozen of your most vicious hired swords. The fighting was murderously brutal, yet surprise was complete, and the victor was never in doubt. Now nothing can stop you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_379;You endured the swaggering and arrogance of your wife's new allies for a few days. Then, one day while they were out hunting, you tracked them down with a dozen hired swords. Unfortunately, they had somehow learned of your intentions, and were ready and waiting. The fighting was murderous, but never truly in doubt. Thankfully, you escaped with your life. Another attempt will not be possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_380;Your wife's new allies have no true loyalty to her, that much is obvious. Clever as they are, they are still subject to the weaknesses of most men. A few bribes, some well-timed blackmail, and some subtle threats from your hirelings is all it takes to make them bend to your will. Now there is nothing to stop you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_381;Try as you might, you just can't seem to find a weakness among your wife's new allies. The few you can bribe are quickly dismissed, and the others catch onto your scheme far faster than you would like. Before long, any interaction with you becomes hostile. There will be no getting around them, now. Your plan is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_382;Although your wife's new allies were initially suspicious towards you, your charm and chivalrous nature won them over. Before long, you were laughing and drinking with them in the [FromFrom.Capital.GetName] brothel, and they were openly questioning the purpose of their mission. Perhaps [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] would be better off with you in charge? Now there is nothing to stop you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_383;You were determined to show [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s retainers that you were a superior ruler, in whose hands your wife's dominions would truly be best served. Unfortunately, what you assumed to be a lordly bearing came across to them as laughably arrogant. Soon, they were sniggering behind your back and swaggering about in ridiculing imitation. Your plan is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_384;I don't know how he did it, but somehow [From.GetFirstName] has managed to circumvent the new retainers. They are nowhere to be seen, and he is swaggering around my castle in [Root.Capital.GetName] as if he already owns it. Perhaps I should resign myself to the fact that he does.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_384;That sneaky bastard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_385;[From.GetTitledFirstName] responded to your letter quickly, arriving at [Root.Capital.GetName] alone and listening intently to your tale of woe. [From.GetSheHeCap] frowned at your mention of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s behavior, and came up with a plan to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_385;...find and intimidate anyone supporting him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_385;...use bribery to eliminate his supporters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_FemRule_385;...drum up popular support among your vassals;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_386;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] recently visited [From.GetFirstName], and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is clearly the one responsible for the campaign of intimidation that is making your supporters drop like flies. [From.GetFirstName] would never have the gumption to do this. Regardless, the tactic is successful...and very soon your plans are in tatters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

As clever as the tactic might be, it's not enough. The outrage actually gains you MORE supporters, and before long they have to abandon their plan completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_388;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] recently visited [From.GetFirstName], and not long after your supporters began to waver. Too late you learn that [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is bribing and blackmailing many of them, causing others to run for the hills. You try to salvage the situation, but it's no use. [From.GetFirstName] has won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_389;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] recently visited [From.GetFirstName], and not long after you learned that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was attempting to bribe away your supporters. Thankfully, you acted quickly enough, and stoked their outrage to the point that now you have even more supporters that before. [From.GetFirstName] is finished.[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] recently visited [From.GetFirstName], and not long after you learned that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was attempting to bribe away your supporters.

EVTDESC_FemRule_390;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] recently visited [From.GetFirstName], and not long after you learned [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was touring the countryside, visiting vassals and drumming up support for [From.GetFirstName]. You attempted to intervene, but it was too late. [From.GetFirstName] has too much support for her cause now. Your plan is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_391;[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] recently visited [From.GetFirstName], and not long after you learned [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was touring the countryside, visiting vassals and drumming up support for [From.GetFirstName]. Whatever they thought to do, it failed. Many of the vassals are laughing at her expense, and you're laughing along with them. It was a nice try, feeble as it was.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_392;[FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName]'s plan worked. Already [From.GetFirstName] is seen far less around [Root.Capital.GetName], and when he is it is spent sulking. You have no illusions that he might not try again someday, but for now [From.GetFirstName]'s ambitions have been ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_392;What a relief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_393;It worked. You went to [FromFrom.Capital.GetName] and came up with a plan to stop [From.GetTitledFirstName] from taking over [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s lands, and while your efforts won't win you any favor with the man they did stop his ambitions cold. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] was incredibly grateful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_394;It was not enough. [FromFromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] did what [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] could, but [From.GetFirstName] caught wind of the plan too quickly and was able to counter it. Indeed, he stoked enough outrage that now he has even more support than before. Alas, there is nothing to be done now but give in to his demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_394;That bastard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_395;You went to [FromFrom.Capital.GetName] and came up with a plan to stop [From.GetTitledFirstName] from taking over [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s lands, but in the end it was not enough. [From.GetFirstName] caught wind of the effort and intervened, stoking enough outrage so that now he has even more support than before. [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is left with no recourse but to give in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_395;I'm sorry, [FromFrom.GetFirstName], I did what I could;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_396;You can tell that [From.GetFirstName] is not pleased, but there is nothing more she can do. No-one else can help her, and the laws of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are clearly on your side. By the right of Jure Uxoris, her titles are yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_396;It is done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_397;The principle of Jure Uxoris states that a husband owns the titles of his wife by right, and the laws of [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName] support it. Thus [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] has stepped forward and demanded [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s titles become his—and he cannot be denied. As of today, he has officially usurped his wife's lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_397;What? This is an outrage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_FemRule_397;If that is how it must be, I will not oppose it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_FemRule_398;You begin exerting more and more influence in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. You supercede [From.GetFirstName]'s commands, and give orders to the guardsmen...and you can tell they are almost relieved that a man is doing so. The council reports to you almost before they report to [From.GetFirstName]. Either she acts soon or she will have no hope of stopping you from usurping her titles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_FemRule_398;Let's see what she does...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTOOLTIP_FemRule_111;I am ready to be acknowledged as my father's legitimate heir.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_FemRule_140;Tell your liege of your retirement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_FemRule_145;Request to be your lady's champion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_FemRule_146;Your champion hears of the request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
