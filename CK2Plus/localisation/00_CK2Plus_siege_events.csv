EVTNAME_Plus_1001;[From.Siege.GetName] Besieged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1001;[Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFOA], an enemy host is approaching [From.Siege.GetName] with the intent to besiege it. If you wish to flee to safety, you must do so quickly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1001_prisoner;You can hear the sounds of battle from your prison cell. Could it be? Is [From.Siege.GetName] being besieged?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1001_incapable;In your addled state, you can barely understand what is going on. [From.Siege.GetName] is being attacked? By whom?! People are urgently ushering you through the halls, and there is shouting everywhere. Where are they taking you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1001_child;The grown-ups at [From.Siege.GetName] seem awfully nervous. An army is coming, they say, and they intend to send you somewhere safe. It makes no sense to you. Isn't [From.Siege.GetName] the safest place in the entire world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1001_away;Word has reached you in [Root.Location.GetName] that the enemy has attacked [From.Siege.GetName]. How long it can withstand the siege is uncertain, but with any luck it will be long enough to protect your loved ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1001;I hope they get everyone to safety!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1001_prisoner;Sadly, there is nothing I can do from here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1001_incapable;Run? Run now? Where are we going?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1001_child;They never tell me anything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1001_alone;I must get to safety at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1001_family;*My* safety is all that matters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1001;I am not leaving without my family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1001_family;Send my family to safety - I must defend [From.Siege.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1001_alone;I am not going anywhere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_1005;Escape Attempt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1005;My [Root.GetLordLady], if [Root.Siege.GetName] falls into the hands of the enemy, you could be placed into jeopardy. If you are going to attempt an escape, it must be now. We will not get another chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1005;Slip out a postern door at midnight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1005;Brave the sewers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1005;Just give me a rope...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1005;I think it's better we wait;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1006;Just as I thought I had made it to freedom, a group of armed men appear under the banner of my foe.  Exhausted from my escape, it is all I can do to croak the word 'yield.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1007;In the dead of night, as a low mist hung about the curtain wall, you creep out a postern door and float across the moat on an inflated sheepskin.  It's only by the ineptitude of the enemy watch that you stagger, dripping wet, through the siege lines and to the safety of a nearby wood.  Thanks be to God! ... Although any family left behind is likely angry with us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1008;Your steward leads you down into the store rooms to a passage you didn't even know existed.  Beyond it, a dismal tunnel full of death and decay, and you are only too glad to reach the moat and relatively fresh water. I hope I never have to do that again!  It only now occurs to me that any family left behind is likely angry with me for leaving them in the hands of the enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1009;They said only a lunatic would attempt climbing down the southeast wall, and certainly the enemy agreed!  A near thing, too, when my foot slipped on that patch of moss.  My brush with death over with, and safety assured, it only now occurs to me that any family left behind will see this as a desertion, not a bold deed of heroism...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1010;My [Root.GetLordLady], we've caught [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] while [From.GetSheHe] was trying to sneak out of the castle!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1010;Take [From.GetHerHim] back to my dungeons immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1021;My [Root.GetLordLady], we've finally taken [FromFrom.GetName]... and it appears [FromFrom.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] numbers among those within. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1021;Take [siege_owner.GetHerHim] prisoner at once;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1021;Imprison [siege_owner.GetHerHim] and anyone else we find;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1021;Kill [siege_owner.GetHerHim] and anyone else within;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1021;Leave [siege_owner.GetHerHim] and [siege_owner.GetHerHis] family be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1022;My [Root.GetLordLady], we've finally taken [FromFrom.GetName]... but it appears [FromFrom.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has gone into hiding. We can search for [FromFrom.Holder.GetHerHim], but [FromFrom.Holder.GetSheHe] will not be easy to find. What would you have us do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1022;Find [FromFrom.Holder.GetHerHim]—[FromFrom.Holder.GetSheHe]'s the only one we want;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1022;Find [FromFrom.Holder.GetHerHim] and anyone else of importance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1022;Kill everyone you can find;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1023;My [Root.GetLordLady], we've finally taken [FromFrom.GetName], and it appears that [FromFrom.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] may have family within... though some may have gone into hiding. If they have, they may not be very easy to find. What would you have us do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1023;Imprison anyone of importance you can find;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1023;Leave them be, they are unimportant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1024;My [Root.GetLordLady], our forces report that [FromFrom.Holder.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has prisoners being held at [FromFrom.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1024;Release all prisoners;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1024;Transfer them to MY dungeon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1024;Release anyone with whom we have common cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_1024;Release only my relatives;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_Plus_1024;Whoever these people are, they smell like they belong there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1026;As the forces of [siege_attacker.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] finally burst through the gates of [FromFromFrom.GetName], you assumed they would take you prisoner if they found you... but that was not to be. You heard the screams before they reached you, and, upon realizing they were slaughtering everyone, you tried to flee. Eventually they caught up to you and summarily put you to the sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1026;I will be avenged!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1027;As the forces of [siege_attacker.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] finally burst through the gates of [siege_holding.GetName], you attempted to evade them... but ultimately were unsuccessful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1029;After the siege, we found §Y[From.GetTitledName]§! and immediately took [From.GetHerHim] prisoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1031;We have finally taken [FromFrom.GetName], and the men are already busy looting and setting fires. A glorious day! I know the men are ready to slake their bloody thirsts upon the holding. What instructions shall I give them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1031;Tell them to control themselves—I want prisoners;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_1031;No, let them celebrate their victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_1031;Tonight we offer sacrifices to [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1032;As the attackers finally burst through the gates of [siege_holding.GetName], you attempted to evade them... and, while you were ultimately successful in escaping, you did not do so unscathed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_1032;At least I got away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_1033;As the forces of [siege_attacker.GetTitledFirstName] finally burst through the gates of [siege_holding.GetName], you assumed they would take you prisoner if they found you... but that was not to be. Once you saw the daggers, and heard their horrid chanting, you realized with horror that they were going to sacrifice you to their pagan gods...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
