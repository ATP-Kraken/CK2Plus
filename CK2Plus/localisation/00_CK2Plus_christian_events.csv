EVTDESC_Plus_2000;[Root.Guardian.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has spoken to you a great deal about the ideals behind the Cathar faith, and how one who aspires to be closer to God must conduct themselves. [Root.Guardian.GetHerHisCap] words have made a great impact upon you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2000;I will be a good Cathar, I think;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2001;The Cathar Church frowns upon contact with members of the opposite sex. Thus you are raised mostly among other Cathar men, and rarely see girls your age at all. You start to feel strange urges, and it occurs to you that the church really only frowns upon reproduction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2001;It's technically not banned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2002;The Cathar Church frowns upon contact with members of the opposite sex. Thus you are raised mostly among other Cathar women, and rarely see boys your age at all. You start to feel strange urges, and it occurs to you that the church really only frowns upon reproduction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2003;A life of sinful urges is not something you can relegate yourself to. You are a devout Cathar, and that means that such sins are best put behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2003;For the glory of God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2005;Another lost soul brought into this world. Although your new child fills you with joy, you know that having children is frowned upon by the Cathar Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2005;I love [From.GetHerHim] anyway;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2006;After a long search, a young boy has been found who might make for an ideal candidate. Your councillors tell you he comes from an orphanage in [adopted_province.GetName], his parents both killed by a recent plague. Although a bit grimy and shy, you feel the child might make a good ruler one day, provided he is cleaned up and raised properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2006;I suppose he will do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_Plus_2010;The Council of Saint-Félix;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2010;A Cathar heresy has been brewing for some time, begun by numerous ascetic priests who espouse strange beliefs regarding there being two Gods--a 'Good God' who created the spiritual realm, and an 'Evil God' who created the material realm and all of humanity, and the reason why all humans are filled with sin--but with the gathering of these priests at a council in the province of Carcassonne, the heresy has begun to spread like wildfire. At this council, the priests codified many of their laws and spread territories into 'bishoprics', and they have since gained many followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2010;Another heresy? In MY lands?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2010;This heresy must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2010;They are led by a Bogomilist, I hear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_Plus_2011;The Albigensian Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2011;The Cathar faithful desire nothing more than peace, but the men of this evil world will not let that be. And so, a change in philosophy is in order. The Cathar are now permitted, no required, to make holy war upon the unbelievers in order to drive them off and bring about the salvation of mankind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2011;So must it be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_Plus_2013;The Cathar Patriarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2013;The growing power of the Cathar Church has led it to organize itself as a reflection of the Catholic Church. Created through the political will of [From.GetTitledName], this new Church has a leader: [new_cathar_pope.GetTitledName], elected at a special gathering of bishops in [From.Capital.GetName]. The Cathar world rejoices at the news!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2013;Is this their idea of a Pope?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2013;And so the Christian world devours itself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2013;Glory to Jesus!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2015;John Wycliff;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2015;A discredited seminary student by the name of John Wycliff has been spending his time in [new_lollard_stronghold.GetName], preaching his heretical thoughts on the Bible to the peasants--specifically that the Catholic Church must be reformed. He speaks out against the greed and excess of Catholic priests, the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and the over-emphasis of reverence paid to Christian idols. Many peasants, having no love for the corrupt priests of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], have embraced his teachings and the Lollard heresy is spreading like wildfire throughout the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2015;Where is my Archbishop?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2015;Terrible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2015;A wise man indeed;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_Plus_2015;Let the heathens fight each other;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2016;As you men storm the church, they discover a rich cache of icons and relics, all of it gilded in gold and surely belonging to [From.Owner.GetTitledName]. Such greed and devotion to icons goes against everything the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith stands for...but this is still a holy place, is it not?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2016;Destroy them, and take the gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2016;I will not desecrate such beauty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2017;Translation of the Bible;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2017;Several years ago, [Root.GetTitledName] ordered a translation of the Bible into the vernacular. The [Root.Religion.GetName]s believe, after all, that one of the way the Catholic Church maintains control over the masses is by restricting those who can read it to those educated few versed in the ancient tongue of Latin. A non-Latin Bible is, then, something of a revelation. Fortunately, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s Bible is considered to be a fine translation: clear, easy to read, and already quite popular with the common man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2017;Glory to God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2017;This is an affront to God!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2018;Several years ago, [Root.GetTitledName] ordered a translation of the Bible into the vernacular. The [Root.Religion.GetName]s believe, after all, that one of the way the Catholic Church maintains control over the masses is by restricting those who can read it to those educated few versed in the ancient tongue of Latin. A non-Latin Bible is, then, something of a revelation. Unfortunately for [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [Root.GetHerHis] new Bible is not only considered something of a poor translation -- with far too many parts obviously swayed by the politics of the day -- it is mostly mocked outside of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and mostly disregarded. Even so, it is of great interest to many, and has aided the spread of the [Root.Religion.GetName]s faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2018;We will keep working on it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2020;The death of [From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] means that [From.GetHerHis] efforts to translate the Bible into the vernacular have been put on hold. Not only that, they are in disarray, and it will take a fair amount of effort to continue the task. Alternatively, the plan could be stopped now, and at least some of the expense regained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2020;I will continue [From.GetHerHis] efforts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2020;[From.GetHerHisCap] dream dies with [From.GetHerHim];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2021_not_lollard;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nYou are a holy [Root.GetManWoman], it is true...but you are also not a believer in the ideals we Lollards uphold. You revel in excess and greed, and thus I cannot allow you to retain your titles in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. They are to be revoked at once, and given to a more worthy member of the clergy.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2021_wicked;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nI understand you espouse the Lollard ideals...yet I see no evidence of that in your conduct. You make a mockery of all we believe, and thus I cannot allow you to retain your titles in [From.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. They are to be revoked at once, and given to a more worthy member of the clergy.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2021_high_tier;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal],\nSince you are a priest who understands the tenets of the Lollard faith, you will see why I have come to the belief that you have gained far too many titles for your station. A good [Root.GetManWoman] of the Lord should attend to more simple matters. Thus I hereby declare that your greater titles be claimed by the [From.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2021;So be it -- there is nothing to be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2021;No! I will fight [From.GetHerHim], if I must!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2022;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nIf that is what you have decided, then so must it be. My titles are yours.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2023;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nIf you truly feel that my greater titles are not suitable for a Christian priest, there is nothing I can do to stop your claim.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2024;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI will not bow down to the petty demands of a [GetFromRootInsult] [Root.GetManWoman] such as yourself, not now and not ever!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2024;[From.GetSheHeCap] will regret that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2025;Brother Angelo;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2025;A disgruntled Catholic monk by the name of Brother Angelo has heavily criticized [Root.GetTitledName], and in so doing has rocked the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. Brother Angelo denies that [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is legally the pope, as [Root.GetSheHe] has abrogated the Rule of St. Francis -- which, according to his doctrine, represented the pure and simple Gospel. He has asserted that all of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]'s decrees are thus invalid, and that all Catholics who follow the Pope's will have lost the grace of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2025;The man is clearly a heretic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2025;He sounds like a man with the right ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2025;Criticize the Pope? Unheard of!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2027;The words of Brother Angelo have been weighing on your soul. Too many churchmen are more concerned more with power and money than with their holy calling, and the result is a Catholic Church that is rife with corruption. Perhaps the Fraticelli are right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2027;I believe in their call for reform;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2027;Right or not, I will follow the Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_Plus_2030;The Poor of Lyons;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2030;A wealthy merchant of Lyons by the name of Pierre Valdes gave up all his earthly possessions and began wandering the countryside as a preacher after a brush with death. He has been condemning the Catholic Church for its corruption, as well as calling for a return to a more Biblical lifestyle. The man has rapidly gained followers amongst the poor of Lyons, and his disciples have ranged even further and begun seeking converts in northern Italy -- enough to cause considerable concern within the Catholic hierarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2030;The man is clearly a heretic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2030;And thus another heresy begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2030;Another problem for the Catholics;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2031;The founding of the Waldensian Church was mostly underground, and the so the early initiates organized themselves into cells. The Doctores would lead the cells and train Novellani, who would go and preach to the masses, while the Sandaliati would travel to keep the cells in touch. It is a tradition that has continued to this day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2031;I am Sandaliati;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2031;I am Doctores;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_Plus_2031;I am Novellani;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2032;As a Waldensian [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], you are considered to have brought considerable renown to the cause. What some might have disregarded as a passing thing is now given far more serious weight in the world, perhaps even enough to one day challenge the gravitas of the Pope himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2032;Lux Lucit in Tenebris!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2034;As your men storm the church, you cut down a [From.Owner.Religion.GetName] priest trying to protect a relic, gilded in gold. These false idols are a means to deceive the peasants and confuse ignorant fools. You are of half a mind to destroy them and return the wealth to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2034;Do it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2034;I would rather keep it for myself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2035_rome;Rome, the Eternal City, and the source of all the corruption of the Church. It is full of treasures stolen from the people, false relics to deceive the gullible. Your men have their orders: destroy them all, and return the wealth to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2035_canterbury;Canterbury, where the tomb Thomas Beckett lies...or lied, since it is there no longer. The tomb has been destroyed by your holy wrath, no longer able to tempt poor Christian fools away from devoting their faith to false relics, and the wealth of its riches returned to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2035_santiago;You don't know who is buried in this shrine, but you know it is not St. James. That is just a false legend made to trick pilgrims and take their money. Well, no longer. You give the bones a proper burial, and then burn the shrine down around you. The wealth of its relics have been returned to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2035_koln;In the Cathedral of Köln, there lies the Sarcophagus of the Magi: over two meters of gilded silver and jewels. Why waste such wealth on falsehoods, idols that lure the foolish away from their true faith in God, when it could be given to the poor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2035;So must it be;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2036;The Sacking of [FromFrom.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2036_rome;After the Waldensians seized Rome, they proceeded to destroy any and all holy relics they could reach, stripping all the wealth from the Roman churches. The bones of St. Peter have been thrown out and cast into the street, the Chains of St. Paul melted down, and the Scala Santa smashed and destroyed. Catholics everywhere are distraught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2036_canterbury;Canterbury, the great pilgrimage site for all of the British Isles has been destroyed, the tomb of St. Thomas Beckett desecrated by the Waldensians. Even as the heretics rejoice at their victory, so are Catholics elsewhere distraught at the loss of the holy relics now cast aside as worthless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2036_santiago;The Way of St. James has no endpoint now, as Santiago de Compostela has fallen to the Waldensians. The shrine of St. James has been destroyed, the bones once therein now missing, and the many holy relics which belonged to the shrine have either been destroyed or cast to the people as trinkets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2036_koln;The Grand Cathedral of Köln now smoulders as the Waldensians strip it of everything of value. Countless relics have been destroyed, including the Sarcophagus of the Magi: over two meters of gilded silver and jewels, all melted down. The Waldensians say that the poor shall be able to eat for a year on what was stored there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2036;Sacrilege!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2036;A victory for sense and righteousness!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2037;All Waldensian lords are expect to give charity to the poor and disenfranchised in their realm. Now, that tenet is tested as a large number of refugees have arrived into [Root.Capital.GetName] from the provinces of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName]. The war has left them destitute, and their numbers have overwhelmed the ability of the city to support them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2037;They must be helped;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2037;There is nothing to be done;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2038;In the sermon today, your priest expounded on the sin of greed, and how no greedy [Root.GetManWoman] can enter heaven. You just wish he didn't use yourself as an example.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2038;He's not wrong...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2039;A recent opportunity to improve the facilities in [Root.Capital.GetName] for assisting the poor has arisen, and it is something your councillors tell you will not only assist the people but make the city far better than it has ever been. It does, however, require a significant investment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2039;Then we must do it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2039;We cannot afford it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2040;The ideals of the Waldensian faith have made a big impression on you. You have decided to be charitable at all times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2040;The poor need our help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2041;Messalians believe everyone is born with demons inside them, and those demons can only be expelled by intercession of the Holy Spirit...which can only be summoned with intense asceticism and prayer. It may take years to finally succeed, but you are ready to begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2041;Let the demons be driven out, once and for all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2042;You have prayed and fasted for months on end, but despite all your efforts you are still haunted by the sins of the flesh. You are forced to give up in defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2042_lunacy;You have prayed and fasted for months on end, but in the end you are forced to admit your mind is still not your own. If anything, the spells of lunacy have become worse as weakness and dizziness beset you, and there are nights were you wander through the castle, howling. The demons are too strong, and you are forced to admit defeat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2042_possession;You have prayed and fasted for months on end, but in the end you are forced to admit your mind is still not your own. In fact, the visions come more frequently, now. Lucifer himself has been speaking with you, whispering of your lamentable weakness...and you have to admit you agree. The demons within you are simply too strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2042;I will try again, I swear it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_lust;It has taken many, many months of prayer and cold baths, but you have finally succeeded in driving the daemon of Luxuria from your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_gluttony;It has taken many, many months of prayer and painful dedication, but you have finally succeeded in driving the daemon of Gula from your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_greed;It has taken many, many months of prayer and many painful donations to the poor, but you have finally succeeded in driving the daemon of Avaritia from your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_sloth;It has taken many, many months of prayer and far too many early morning exercises, but you have finally succeeded in driving the daemon of Acedia from your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_wrath;It has taken many, many months of prayer and more slow counts to ten than you can even recall, but you have finally succeeded in driving the daemon of Ira from your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_envy;It has taken many, many months of prayer and a great deal of contemplative meditation, but you have finally succeeded in driving the daemon of Invidia from your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_pride;It has taken many, many months of prayer and a great deal of contemplative meditation, but you have finally succeeded in driving the daemon of Superbia from your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_cruelty;It has taken many, many months of prayer and far too many visits to the local orphanage, but you have finally succeeded in driving the daemon of Cruelty from your soul.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_possession;You almost thought this day would never come. After many, many months of prayer and meditation, you wake up one morning and...the voices in your head are simply gone. You cannot even remember a time when you felt so in control of yourself. The demon in your mind has finally been driven out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2043_lunacy;You almost thought this day would never come. After many, many months of prayer and meditation, you wake up one morning and...your mind is simply your own. No more irrational impulses, no more dangerous thoughts. It is as if they simply never were. You cannot even remember a time when you felt so in control of yourself. The demon in your mind has finally been driven out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2043;Finally, I am free!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2044_not_messalian;Since you are no longer Messalian, there is no point in continuing the prayer and fasting. There are no demons within you to cast out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2044_prisoner;While you would happily continue your ritual prayer and fasting, it is simply not possible to do so while you are imprisoned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2044_incapable;While you would happily continue your ritual prayer and fasting, such rigorousness is now simply beyond your capacity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2046;Despite your prayers, you are still haunted by lustful dreams at night. The craving for carnal pleasures feels as if it will overwhelm you at times. The demon within may be too strong for you to expel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2046; I will surround myself with those of my own gender, no-one else!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2046;I cannot resist the temptation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2047_male;The bold contours and muscles of the young men of your court are becoming irresistible. You realize you've been spending your days idly dreaming of their strong, oiled arms...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2047_female;The soft scents of the young women of your court are becoming overpowering. A nice warm bath sounds nice, where you can can massage oil into one or two of their young, nubile bodies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2047;I must resist temptation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2047;I have no choice but to give in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2048;You have never felt this hungry in your life. You think of all the food stored in your kitchens. All the prayer in the world won't help if you starve to death...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2048;I cannot surrender to the sins of the flesh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2049;The sound of rattling dice draws you toward a pair of guardsmen, gambling for silver. It just so happens you have a set of loaded dice in your pocket, given to you from a friend in jest. Should you teach these fools a lesson?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2049;No, gambling is sinful and greedy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2049;Perhaps just a few games won't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2050;You haven't been keeping up on your prayers to expel the daemon of Sloth, which, beyond the irony of the situation, has been troubling you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2050;I will make a determined effort;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2050;The prayers can wait until tomorrow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2051;A particularly irritating courtier has been on your nerves of late, when you happened to spot him prancing around with the most ridiculous hat on, causing your blood to boil.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2051;Slowly count to ten...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2051;Have that hat nailed to his head;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2052;Your attempts to pray your envy away have been difficult. Lately, you have begun coveting a fine horse possessed by one of your courtiers, one who has been the pride of all [Root.Capital.GetName]. It would be so simple a matter for you to just take it for yourself. What could he do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2052;I can do without another horse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2052;It is rightfully mine, anyhow;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2053;Your prayers to end your pride have not been successful. However, a young member of your church has proven himself skilled at exorcisms. Do you own up and ask for his assistance?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2053;Humbly ask him for help;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2053;No, that's ridiculous! What could he do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2054;A criminal is brought before you for justice, having been caught stealing a small breakfast roll from the market. Although you have been trying to end your cruel inclinations, letting this man go will reflect poorly on you...you do have a reputation to uphold, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2054;Let him go free;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_Plus_2054;Hang him as he deserves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2055;Choose a patron saint to watch over you and to who you will direct your prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTD_Plus_2055;St. Adelphius, the founder of the Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2056;In a dark cellar, at the stroke of midnight, you take the oath.

There, you learn the secret Truths of Heaven and Hell, passed down from Adelphius himself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2056;Better to reign in Hell...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_Plus_2057;The Army of Lucifer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2057;The growing power of the Messalians can no longer be denied. With the aid of [Root.GetTitledName], a group of fanatics, peasants, and madmen have now banded together to create their own army -- one that has, much to the shock of Christians elsewhere in the world, taken as its patron saint none other than Lucifer the Lighbringer, greatest of the Archangels and the King of Hell. Lucifer, they believe, is no more than an agent of chaos and change, and in His name they intend to bring about a change in the world. They will drive the demons of sin from the ranks of humanity with the force of their arms...if they are given the chance, that is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_Plus_2057;A glorious day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2059;My [Root.GetLordLady], this extremely generous donation will not be forgotten. You have my friendship, as well as that of all the [From.Religion.GetName] faithful.

EVTDESC_Plus_2061;My [Root.GetLordLady], this antagonism is completely unwarranted! The [holy_order_name.GetName] serves [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], but, one has to wonder, do you?\n\nWith anger and sadness,\n\n[From.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_Plus_2062_male;My [Root.GetLordLady],\nI have thought long and hard about this, and I believe I have come to the conclusion that I must dedicate my life utterly to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.
